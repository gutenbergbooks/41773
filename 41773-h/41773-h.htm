<p><span class="bold">LAMENNAIS, HUGUES FÉLICITÉ ROBERT DE<a name="ar1" id="ar1"></a></span> (1782-1854),
French priest, and philosophical and political writer, was born
at Saint Malo, in Brittany, on the 19th of June 1782. He was
the son of a shipowner of Saint Malo ennobled by Louis XVI.
for public services, and was intended by his father to follow
mercantile pursuits. He spent long hours in the library of an
uncle, devouring the writings of Rousseau, Pascal and others.
He thereby acquired a vast and varied, though superficial,
erudition, which determined his subsequent career. Of a sickly
and sensitive nature, and impressed by the horrors of the French
Revolution, his mind was early seized with a morbid view of
life, and this temper characterized him throughout all his changes
of opinion and circumstance. He was at first inclined towards
rationalistic views, but partly through the influence of his
brother Jean Marie (1775-1861), partly as a result of his philosophical
and historical studies, he felt belief to be indispensable
to action and saw in religion the most powerful leaven of the
community. He gave utterance to these convictions in the
<i>Réflexions sur l&rsquo;état de l&rsquo;église en France pendant le 18<span class="sp">ième</span> siècle
et sur sa situation actuelle</i>, published anonymously in Paris in
1808. Napoleon&rsquo;s police seized the book as dangerously ideological,
with its eager recommendation of religious revival and
active clerical organization, but it awoke the ultramontane
spirit which has since played so great a part in the politics of
churches and of states.</p>

<p>As a rest from political strife, Lamennais devoted most of
the following year to a translation, in exquisite French, of the
<i>Speculum Monachorum</i> of Ludovicus Blosius (Louis de Blois)
which he entitled <i>Le Guide spirituel</i> (1809). In 1811 he received
the tonsure and shortly afterwards became professor of mathematics
in an ecclesiastical college founded by his brother at Saint
Malo. Soon after Napoleon had concluded the Concordat with
Pius VII. he published, in conjunction with his brother, <i>De la
tradition de l&rsquo;église sur l&rsquo;institution des évêques</i> (1814), a writing
occasioned by the emperor&rsquo;s nomination of Cardinal Maury to
the archbishopric of Paris, in which he strongly condemned
the Gallican principle which allowed bishops to be created
irrespective of the pope&rsquo;s sanction. He was in Paris at the first
Bourbon restoration in 1814, which he hailed with satisfaction,
less as a monarchist than as a strenuous apostle of religious
regeneration. Dreading the <i>Cent Jours</i>, he escaped to London,
where he obtained a meagre livelihood by giving French lessons
in a school founded by the abbé Jules Carron for French émigrés;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>125</span>
he also became tutor at the house of Lady Jerningham, whose
first impression of him as an imbecile changed into friendship.
On the final overthrow of Napoleon in 1815 he returned to Paris,
and in the following year, with many misgivings as to his calling,
he yielded to his brother&rsquo;s and Carron&rsquo;s advice, and was ordained
priest by the bishop of Rennes.</p>

<p>The first volume of his great work, <i>Essai sur l&rsquo;indifférence
en matière de religion</i>, appeared in 1817 (Eng. trans. by Lord
Stanley of Alderley, London, 1898), and affected Europe like
a spell, investing, in the words of Lacordaire, a humble priest
with all the authority once enjoyed by Bossuet. Lamennais
denounced toleration, and advocated a Catholic restoration
to belief. The right of private judgment, introduced by Descartes
and Leibnitz into philosophy and science, by Luther into
religion and by Rousseau and the Encyclopaedists into politics
and society, had, he contended, terminated in practical atheism
and spiritual death. Ecclesiastical authority, founded on the
absolute revelation delivered to the Jewish people, but supported
by the universal tradition of all nations, he proclaimed to be
the sole hope of regenerating the European communities. Three
more volumes (Paris, 1818-1824) followed, and met with a mixed
reception from the Gallican bishops and monarchists, but with
the enthusiastic adhesion of the younger clergy. The work
was examined by three Roman theologians, and received the
formal approval of Leo XII. Lamennais visited Rome at the
pope&rsquo;s request, and was offered a place in the Sacred College,
which he refused. On his return to France he took a prominent
part in political work, and together with Chateaubriand, the
vicomte de Villèle, was a regular contributor to the <i>Conservateur</i>,
but when Villèle became the chief of the supporters of absolute
monarchy, Lamennais withdrew his support and started two
rival organs, <i>Le Drapeau blanc</i> and <i>Le Mémorial catholique</i>.
Various other minor works, together with <i>De la religion considérée
dans ses rapports avec l&rsquo;ordre civil et politique</i> (2 vols., 1825-1826),
kept his name before the public.</p>

<p>He retired to La Chênaie and gathered round him a host of
brilliant disciples, including C. de Montalembert, Lacordaire
and Maurice de Guérin, his object being to form an organized
body of opinion to persuade the French clergy and laity to throw
off the yoke of the state connexion. With Rome at his back,
as he thought, he adopted a frank and bold attitude in denouncing
the liberties of the Gallican church. His health broke down
and he went to the Pyrenees to recruit. On his return to La
Chênaie in 1827 he had another dangerous illness, which powerfully
impressed him with the thought that he had only been
dragged back to life to be the instrument of Providence. <i>Les
Progrès de la révolution et de la guerre contre l&rsquo;église</i> (1828) marked
Lamennais&rsquo;s complete renunciation of royalist principles, and
henceforward he dreamt of the advent of a theocratic democracy.
To give effect to these views he founded <i>L&rsquo;Avenir</i>, the first number
of which appeared on the 16th of October 1830, with the motto
&ldquo;God and Liberty.&rdquo; From the first the paper was aggressively
democratic; it demanded rights of local administration, an
enlarged suffrage, universal freedom of conscience, freedom of
instruction, of meeting, and of the press. Methods of worship
were to be criticized, improved or abolished in absolute submission
to the spiritual, not to the temporal authority. With
the help of Montalembert, he founded the <i>Agence générale pour
la défense de la liberté religieuse</i>, which became a far-reaching
organization, it had agents all over the land who noted any
violations of religious freedom and reported them to headquarters.
As a result, <i>L&rsquo;Avenir&rsquo;s</i> career was stormy, and the
opposition of the Conservative bishops checked its circulation;
Lamennais, Montalembert and Lacordaire resolved to suspend
it for a while, and they set out to Rome in November 1831
to obtain the approval of Gregory XVI. The &ldquo;pilgrims of
liberty&rdquo; were, after much opposition, received in audience by
the pope, but only on the condition that the object which brought
them to Rome should not be mentioned. This was a bitter
disappointment to such earnest ultramontanes, who received,
a few days after the audience, a letter from Cardinal Pacca,
advising their departure from Rome and suggesting that the
Holy See, whilst admitting the justice of their intentions, would
like the matter left open for the present. Lacordaire and Montalembert
obeyed; Lamennais, however, remained in Rome, but
his last hope vanished with the issue of Gregory&rsquo;s letter to the
Polish bishops, in which the Polish patriots were reproved and
the tsar was affirmed to be their lawful sovereign. He then
&ldquo;shook the dust of Rome from off his feet.&rdquo; At Munich,
in 1832, he received the encyclical <i>Mirari vos</i>, condemning his
policy; as a result <i>L&rsquo;Avenir</i> ceased and the <i>Agence</i> was dissolved.</p>

<p>Lamennais, with his two lieutenants, submitted, and deeply
wounded, retired to La Chênaie. His genius and prophetic
insight had turned the entire Catholic church against him, and
those for whom he had fought so long were the fiercest of his
opponents. The famous <i>Paroles d&rsquo;un croyant</i>, published in 1834
through the intermediary of Sainte-Beuve, marks Lamennais&rsquo;s
severance from the church. &ldquo;A book, small in size, but immense
in its perversity,&rdquo; was Gregory&rsquo;s criticism in a new encyclical
letter. A tractate of aphorisms, it has the vigour of a Hebrew
prophecy and contains the choicest gems of poetic feeling lost
in a whirlwind of exaggerations and distorted views of kings and
rulers. The work had an extraordinary circulation and was
translated into many European languages. It is now forgotten
as a whole, but the beautiful appeals to love and human brotherhood
are still reprinted in every hand-book of French literature.</p>

<p>Henceforth Lamennais was the apostle of the people alone.
<i>Les Affaires de Rome, des maux de l&rsquo;église et de la société</i> (1837)
came from old habit of religious discussions rather than from his
real mind of 1837, or at most it was but a last word. <i>Le Livre
du peuple</i> (1837), <i>De l&rsquo;esclavage moderne</i> (1839), <i>Politique à
l&rsquo;usage du peuple</i> (1839), three volumes of articles from the
journal of the extreme democracy, <i>Le Monde</i>, are titles of works
which show that he had arrived among the missionaries of
liberty, equality and fraternity, and he soon got a share of their
martyrdom. <i>Le Pays et le gouvernement</i> (1840) caused him a
year&rsquo;s imprisonment. He struggled through difficulties of lost
friendships, limited means and personal illnesses, faithful to
the last to his hardly won dogma of the sovereignty of the people,
and, to judge by his contribution to Louis Blanc&rsquo;s <i>Revue du
progrès</i> was ready for something like communism. He was
named president of the &ldquo;Société de la solidarité républicaine,&rdquo;
which counted half a million adherents in fifteen days. The
Revolution of 1848 had his sympathies, and he started <i>Le
Peuple constituant</i>; however, he was compelled to stop it on
the 10th of July, complaining that silence was for the poor,
but again he was at the head of <i>La Révolution démocratique
et sociale</i>, which also succumbed. In the constituent assembly
he sat on the left till the <i>coupe d&rsquo;état</i> of Napoleon III. in 1851
put an end to all hopes of popular freedom. While deputy he
drew up a constitution, but it was rejected as too radical. Thereafter
a translation of Dante chiefly occupied him till his death,
which took place in Paris on the 27th of February 1854. He
refused to be reconciled to the church, and was buried according
to his own directions at Père La Chaise without funeral rites,
being mourned by a countless concourse of democratic and
literary admirers.</p>

<p>During the most difficult time of his republican period he
found solace for his intellect in the composition of <i>Une voix
de prison</i>, written during his imprisonment in a similar strain
to <i>Les paroles d&rsquo;un croyant</i>. This is an interesting contribution
to the literature of captivity; it was published in Paris in 1846.
He also wrote <i>Esquisse de philosophie</i> (1840). Of the four
volumes of this work the third, which is an exposition of art
as a development from the aspirations and necessities of the
temple, stands pre-eminent, and remains the best evidence of
his thinking power and brilliant style.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>There are two so-called <i>&OElig;uvres complètes de Lamennais</i>, the first in
10 volumes (Paris, 1836-1837), and the other in 10 volumes (Paris,
1844); both these are very incomplete and only contain the works
mentioned above. The most noteworthy of his writings subsequently
published are: <i>Amschaspands et Darvands</i> (1843), <i>Le Deuil
de la Pologne</i> (1846), <i>Mélanges philosophiques et politiques</i> (1856),
<i>Les Évangiles</i> (1846) and <i>La Divine Comédie</i>, these latter being translations
of the Gospels and of Dante.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>126</span></p>

<p>Part of his voluminous correspondence has also appeared. The
most interesting volumes are the following: <i>Correspondance de F. de
Lamennais</i>, edited by E. D. Forgues (2 vols., 1855-1858); <i>&OElig;uvres
inédites de F. Lamennais</i>, edited by Ange Blaize (2 vols., 1866);

by E. D. Forgues (1819-1853); <i>Confidences de Lamennais, lettres
inédites de 1821 à 1848</i>, edited by A. du Bois de la Villerabel (1886);
<i>Lamennais d&rsquo;après des documents inédits</i>, by Alfred Roussel (Rennes,
2 vols., 1892); <i>Lamennais intime, d&rsquo;après une correspondance inédite</i>,

<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LAMENTATIONS<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> (<i>Lamentations of Jeremiah</i>), a book of the
Old Testament. In Hebrew MSS. and editions this little collection
of liturgical poems is entitled <span title="eiha">&#1488;&#1497;&#1499;&#1492;</span> <i>Ah how!</i>, the first
word of ch. i. (and chs. ii., iv.); cf. the books of the Pentateuch,
and the Babylonian Epic of Creation (a far older example).
In the Septuagint it is called <span class="grk" title="Thrênoi">&#920;&#961;&#8134;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span>, &ldquo;Funeral-songs&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Dirges,&rdquo; the usual rendering of Heb. <span title="kinot">&#1511;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;</span> (Am. v. 1; Jer.
vii. 29; 2 Sam. i. 17), which is, in fact, the name in the Talmud
(<i>Baba Bathra</i> 15<i>a</i>) and other Jewish writings; and it was known
as such to the Fathers (Jerome, <i>Cinoth</i>). The Septuagint (B)
introduces the book thus: &ldquo;And it came to pass, after Israel
was taken captive and Jerusalem laid waste, Jeremiah sat
weeping, and lamented with this lamentation over Jerusalem,
and said...,&rdquo; a notice which may have related originally
to the first poem only. Some Septuagint MSS., and the Syriac
and other versions, have the fuller title <i>Lamentations of Jeremiah</i>.
In the Hebrew Bible Lamentations is placed among the <i>Cetubim</i>
or Hagiographa, usually as the middle book of the five <i>Megilloth</i>
or Ferial Rolls (Canticles, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes,
Esther) according to the order of the days on which they are
read in the Synagogue, Lamentations being read on the 9th of
Ab (6th of August), when the destruction of the Temple is
commemorated (<i>Mass. Sopherim</i> 18). But the Septuagint
appends the book to Jeremiah (<i>Baruch</i> intervening), just as
it adds Ruth to Judges; thus making the number of the books
of the Hebrew Canon the same as that of the letters of the Hebrew
alphabet, viz. twenty-two (so Jos. c. Ap. i. 8), instead of the
Synagogal twenty-four (see <i>Baba Bathra</i> 14<i>b</i>).</p>

<p><i>External features and poetical structure.</i>&mdash;These poems exhibit
a peculiar metre, the so-called &ldquo;limping verse,&rdquo; of which Am.
v. 2 is a good instance:</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;She is fállen, to ríse no móre&mdash;</p>
        <p class="i3">Maid I&#347;raël!</p>
<p class="i05">Left lórn upón her lánd&mdash;</p>
        <p class="i3">none raísing hér!&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">A longer line, with three accented syllables, is followed by a
shorter with two. Chs. i.-iii. consist of stanzas of three such
couplets each; chs. iv. and v. of two like Am. v. 2. This metre
came in time to be distinctive of elegy. The text of Lamentations,
however, so often deviates from it, that we can only
affirm the <i>tendency</i> of the poet to cast his couplets into this
type (Driver). Some anomalies, both of metre and of sense,
may be removed by judicious emendation; and many lines
become smooth enough, if we assume a crasis of open vowels
of the same class, or a diphthongal pronunciation of others, or
contraction or silence of certain suffixes as in Syriac. The oldest
elegiac utterances are not couched in this metre; <i>e.g.</i> David&rsquo;s
(2 Sam. iii. 33 f. Abner; <i>ib.</i> i. 19-27 Saul and Jonathan). Yet the
refrain of the latter, &rsquo;<i>Eik náf &rsquo;lu gíbborím</i>, &ldquo;Ah how are heroes
fallen!&rdquo; agrees with our longer line. The remote ancestor of
this Hebrew metre may be recognized in the Babylonian epic
of Gilgamesh, written at least a thousand years earlier:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p class="i3"><i>Ea-báni íbri ku&#7789;áni</i> | <i>Nímru sha çéri</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Eabani, my friend, my little brother! | Leopard of the Wild!&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">and again:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p class="i3"><i>Kíki lúskut</i> | <i>Kíki luqúl-ma</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;How shall I be dumb? | How shall I bewail?</p>
<p class="i05">The friend whom I love | Is turned to clay!&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>Like a few of the Psalms, Lamentations i.-iv. are alphabetical
acrostics. Each poem contains twenty-two stanzas, corresponding
to the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet; and each
stanza begins with its proper letter. (In ch. iii. each of the three
couplets in a stanza begins with the same letter, so that the
alphabet is repeated thrice: cf. Psalm cxix. for an eight-fold
repetition.) The alphabet of Lamentations ii. iii. iv. varies from
the usual order of the letters by placing <i>Pe</i> before <i>Ain</i>. The
same was doubtless the case in ch. i. also until some scribe
altered it. He went no further, because the sense forbade it
in the other instances. The variation may have been one of
local use, either in Judea or in Babylonia; or the author may
have had some fanciful reason for the transposition, such as,
for example, that <i>Pe</i> following <i>Samech</i> (<span title="sp">&#1505;&#1508;</span>) might suggest the
word <span title="sifdu">&#1505;&#1508;&#1491;&#1493;</span>, &ldquo;Wail ye!&rdquo; (2 Sam. iii. 31). Although the oldest
Hebrew elegies are not alphabetic acrostics, it is a curious fact
that the word <span title="aidach">&#1492;&#1497;&#1491;&#1498;</span>, &ldquo;Was he a coward?&rdquo; (Sc. <span title="libo">&#1500;&#1489;&#1493;</span>; Is. vii. 4),
is formed by the initial letters of the four lines on Abner (om.
<span title="ve">&#1493;</span>, line 3); and the initials of the verses of David&rsquo;s great elegy
are <span title="ha amshech eze">&#1492;&#1488; &#1492;&#1502;&#1513;&#1499; &#1488;&#1510;&#1488;</span>, which may be read as a sentence meaning,
perhaps, &ldquo;Lo, I the Avenger&rdquo; (cf. Deut. xxxii. 41, 43) &ldquo;will
go forth!&rdquo;; or the first two letters (<span title="he&prime;alef&prime;">&#1492;&prime;&#1488;&prime;</span>) may stand for <span title="hoi ahi">&#1492;&#1493;&#1497; &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;</span>,
&ldquo;Alas, my brother!&rdquo; (Jer. xxii. 18; cf. xxxiv. 5). In cryptic
fashion the poet thus registers a vow of vengeance on the
Philistines. Both kinds of acrostic occur side by side in the
Psalms. Psalm cx., an acrostic of the same kind as David&rsquo;s
elegy, is followed by Psalms cxi. cxii., which are alphabetical
acrostics, like the Lamentations. Such artifices are not in themselves
greater clogs on poetic expression than the excessive
alliteration of old Saxon verse or the strict rhymes of modern
lyrics. (Alliteration, both initial and internal, is common in
Lamentations.)</p>

<p>As the final piece, ch. v. may have suffered more in transmission
than those which precede it&mdash;even to the extent of losing the
acrostic form (like some of the Psalms and Nahum i.), besides
half of its stanzas. If we divide the chapter into quatrains,
like ch. iv., we notice several vestiges of an acrostic. The <i>Aleph</i>
stanza (verses 7, 8) still precedes the <i>Beth</i> (verses 9, 10), and the
<i>Ain</i> is still quite clear (verses 17, 18; cf. i. 16). Transposing
verses 5, 6, and correcting their text, we see that the <i>Jod</i> stanza
(verses 3, 4) precedes the <i>Lamed</i> (verses 6, 5), <i>Caph</i> having
disappeared between them. With this clue, we may rearrange
the other quatrains in alphabetical sequence, each according
to its initial letter. We thus get a broken series of eleven stanzas,
beginning with the letters
<bdo dir="ltr"><span title="alef">&#1488;</span> (verses 7, 8), <span title="beth">&#1489;</span> (9, 10), <span title="hei">&#1492;</span> (21, 22),

(13, <span title="horim">&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;</span>; 14),

<bdo dir="ltr"><span title="nun">&#1504;</span> (11, 12), <span title="ayin">&#1506;</span> (17, 18),
and <span title="shin">&#1513;</span> (15, 16), successively. An internal connexion will now
be apparent in all the stanzas.</bdo></p>

<p><i>General subject and outline of contents.</i>&mdash;The theme of Lamentations
is the final siege and fall of Jerusalem (586 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), and the
attendant and subsequent miseries of the Jewish people.</p>

<p>In ch. i. we have a vivid picture of the distress of Zion, after
all is over. The poet does not describe the events of the siege,
nor the horrors of the capture, but the painful experience of
subjection and tyranny which followed. Neither this nor ch.
ii. is strictly a &ldquo;dirge.&rdquo; Zion is not dead. She is personified
as a widowed princess, bereaved and desolate, sitting amid
the ruins of her former joys, and brooding over her calamities.
From verse 11<i>c</i> to the end (except verse 17) she herself is the
speaker:&mdash;</p>

<p>Chapter ii.&mdash;&ldquo;Ah how in wrath the Lord | Beclouds Bath-Sion!&rdquo;
The poet laments Yahweh&rsquo;s anger as the true
cause which destroyed city and kingdom, suspended feast
and Sabbath, rejected altar and sanctuary. He mentions
the uproar of the victors in the Temple; the dismantling
of the walls; the exile of king and princes (verses 1-9).
He recalls the mourning in the doomed city; the children
dying of hunger in the streets; the prophets deluding the
people with vain hopes. Passers-by jeered at the fallen city;
and all her enemies triumphed over her (verses 10-17). Sion
is urged to cry to the Lord in protest against His pitiless work
(verses 18-22).</p>

&ldquo;He sunk (<span title="tava">&#1496;&#1489;&#1506;</span>) her gates in the ground,&mdash;He shattered her
bars; He made her king and her princes wander (<span title="ybir">&#1488;&#1489;&#1512;</span>, Jer. xxiii.
1)&mdash;Among the nations without Torah&rdquo; (cf. Ezek. vii. 26 f.).

the Lord, O Virgin Daughter of Zion!&rdquo; Verse 19 is metrically
redundant, and the last clauses do not agree with what follows.
&ldquo;For the life of thy children&rdquo; was altered from &ldquo;for what He
hath done to thee&rdquo; (<span title="al sheolel leha">&#1506;&#1500; &#1513;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500; &#1500;&#1498;</span>); and then the rest was added.
The uniform gloom of this, the most dirge-like of all the pieces, is
unrelieved by a single ray of hope, even the hope of vengeance; cf.
chapters i. iii. iv. <i>ad fin</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Chapter iii.&mdash;Here the nation is personified as a man (cf.
Hos. xi. 1), who laments his own calamities. In view of i.
12-22, ii. 20-22, this is hardly a serious deviation from the
strict form of elegy (<i>Klagelied</i>). Budde makes much of &ldquo;the
close external connexion with ch. ii.&rdquo; The truth is that the break
is as great as between any two of these poems. Chapter ii.
ends with a mother&rsquo;s lament over her slaughtered children;
chapter iii. makes an entirely new beginning, with its abruptly
independent &ldquo;I am the Man!&rdquo; The suppression of the Divine
Name is intentional. Israel durst not breathe it, until compelled
by the climax, verse 18: cf. Am. vi. 10. Contrast its frequency
afterwards, when ground of hope is found in the Divine pity
and purpose (verses 22-40), and when the contrite nation turns
to its God in prayer (verses 55-66). The spiritual aspect of things
is now the main topic. The poet deals less with incident, and
more with the moral significance of the nation&rsquo;s sufferings. It
is the religious culmination of the book. His poem is rather
lyrical than narrative, which may account for some obscurities
in the connexion of thought; but his alphabetic scheme proves
that he <i>designed</i> twenty-two stanzas, not sixty-six detached
couplets. There is something arresting in that bold &ldquo;I am the
Man&rdquo;; and the lyrical intensity, the religious depth and beauty
of the whole, may well blind us to occasional ruggedness of metre
and language, abrupt transitions from figure to figure and
other alleged blemishes, some of which may not have seemed
such to the poet&rsquo;s contemporaries (<i>e.g.</i> the repetition of the
acrostic word, far more frequent in Psalm cxix.); and some
disappear on revision of the text.</p>

became homeless wanderers and outcasts (verses 11-16). Vainly
did the besieged watch for succours from Egypt (Jer. xxxvii.

<p><i>Authorship and date.</i>&mdash;The tradition of Jeremiah&rsquo;s authorship
cannot be traced higher than the Septuagint version. The
prefatory note there may come from a Hebrew MS., but perhaps
refers to chapter i. only (&ldquo;Jeremiah sang <i>this dirge</i>&rdquo;). The
idea that Lamentations was originally appended to Jeremiah
in the Hebrew Canon, as it is in the old versions, and was afterwards
separated from it and added to the other Megilloth for
the liturgical convenience of the Synagogue, rests on the fact
that Josephus (Ap. i. 1, 8) and, following him, Jerome and
Origen reckon 22 books, taking Ruth with Judges and Lamentations
with Jeremiah; whereas the ordinary Jewish reckoning
gives 24 books, as in our Hebrew Bibles. There is no evidence
that this artificial reckoning according to the number of letters
in the Hebrew alphabet was ever much more than a fanciful
suggestion. Even in the Septuagint the existing order may
not be original. It appears likely that Lamentations was not
translated by the same hand as Jeremiah (Nöldeke). Unlike
the latter, the Septuagint Lamentations sticks closely to the
Massoretic text. The two books can hardly have been united
from the first. On the strength of 2 Chron. xxxv. 25, some
ancient writers (<i>e.g.</i> Jerome <i>ad</i> Zech. xii. 11) held that Jeremiah
composed Lamentations. When, however, Josephus (Ant. x.
5, 1) states that Jeremiah wrote an elegy on Josiah still extant
in his day, he may be merely quoting a little too much of Chron.
<i>loc. cit.</i>; and it is obvious that he need not mean our book (see
Whiston&rsquo;s note). It is urged, indeed, that the author of Chronicles
could not have imagined a prophet to have sympathized with
such a king as Zedekiah so warmly as is implied by Lamentations
iv. 20; and, therefore, he must have connected the passage
with Josiah, the last of the good kings. However that may
have been, the Chronicler neither says that Jeremiah wrote <i>all</i>
the elegies comprised in <i>The Qinoth</i>, nor does he imply that the
entire collection consisted of only five pieces. Rather, the
contrary; for he implies that <i>The Qinoth</i> contained not only
Jeremiah&rsquo;s single dirge on Josiah, but also the elegies of &ldquo;all
the singing men and singing women,&rdquo; from the time of Josiah&rsquo;s
death (608) down to his own day (3rd century). The untimely
fate of Josiah became a stock allusion in dirges. It is not meant
that for three centuries the dirge-writers had nothing else to
sing of; much less, that they sang of the fall of Jerusalem (presupposed
by our book) before its occurrence. Upon the whole,
it does not seem probable, either that the Chronicler mistook
Lamentations iv. for Jeremiah&rsquo;s dirge on Josiah, or that the
book he calls <i>The Qinoth</i> was identical with our Qinoth. Later
writers misunderstood him, because&mdash;on the ground of certain
obtrusive similarities between Jeremiah and Lamentations
(see Driver, L.O.T. p. 433 f.), and the supposed reference in
Lamentations iii. 53 ff. to Jeremiah xxxviii. 6 ff., as well as the
fact that Jeremiah was the one well-known inspired writer who
had lived through the siege of Jerusalem&mdash;they naturally enough
ascribed this little book to the prophet. It is certainly true
that the same emotional temperament, dissolving in tears at
the spectacle of the country&rsquo;s woes, and expressing itself to a
great extent in the same or similar language, is noticeable in
the author(s) of Lamentations i.-iv. and in Jeremiah. And both
refer these woes to the same cause, viz. the sins of the nation,
and particularly of its prophets and priests.</p>

<p>This, however, is not enough to prove identity of authorship;
and the following considerations militate strongly against the
tradition. (i.) The language and style of Lamentations are
in general very unlike those of Jeremiah (see the details in
Nägelsbach and Löhr); whatever allowance may be made for
conventional differences in the phraseology of elegiac poetry
and prophetic prose, even of a more or less lyrical cast. (ii.)
Lamentations i.-iv. show a knowledge of Ezekiel (cf. Lamentations
ii. 4c; Ez. xx. 8, 21; Lam. ii. 14; Ez. xii. 24; xiii. 10, 14;
Lam. ii. 15; Ez. xxvii. 3; xxviii. 12; Lam. iv. 20; Ez. xix.
4, 8) and of Is. xl.-lxvi. (Lam. i. 10, <span title="mahmadim">&#1502;&#1495;&#1502;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;</span>; Is. lxiv. 10; Lam.
i. 15; Is. lxiii. 2; Lam. ii. 1; Is. lxvi. 1; Lam. ii. 2<i>c</i>; Is.
xliii. 28; Lam. ii. 13 <i>the 3 verbs</i>; Is. xl. 18, 25; Lam. ii. 15<i>c</i>;
Is. lx. 15<i>b</i>; Lam. iii. 26 <span title="dumam">&#1491;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501;</span>; Is. xlvii. 5; Lam. iii. 30; Is.
i. 6; Lam. iv. 14; Is. lix. 3, 10; Lam. iv. 15; Is. lii. 11; Lam.
iv. 17<i>c</i>; Is. xlv. 20; Lam. iv. 22; Is. xl. 2). Jeremiah does
not quote Ezekiel; and he could hardly have quoted writings
of the age of Cyrus. (iii.) The coincidences of language between
Lamentations and certain late Psalms, such as Psalms lxix.,
lxxiv., lxxx., lxxxviii., lxxxix., cxix., are numerous and significant,
at least as a general indication of date. (iv.) The point of
view of Lamentations sometimes differs from that of the prophet.
This need not be the case in i. 21 f. where the context shows that
the &ldquo;enemies&rdquo; are not the Chaldeans, but Judah&rsquo;s ill neighbours,
Edom, Ammon, Moab and the rest (cf. iv. 21 f.; iii. 59-66 may
refer to the same foes). Ch. ii. 9c may refer to popular prophecy
(&ldquo;<i>her</i> prophets&rdquo;; cf. verse 14), which would naturally be
silenced by the overwhelming falsification of its comfortable
predictions (iv. 14 ff.; cf. Jer. xiv. 13; Ezek. vii. 26 f.; Psalm
lxxiv. 9). But though Jeremiah was by no means disloyal
(Jer. xxxiv. 4 f.), he would hardly have spoken of Zedekiah in
the terms of Lam. iv. 20; and the prophet never looked to
Egypt for help, as the poet of iv. 17 appears to have done. It
must be admitted that Lamentations exhibits, upon the whole,
&ldquo;a poet (more) in sympathy with the old life of the nation,
whose attitude towards the temple and the king is far more
popular than Jeremiah&rsquo;s&rdquo; (W. Robertson Smith); cf. i. 4,
10, 19, ii. 6, 7, 20<i>c</i>. (v.) While we find in Lamentations some
things that we should not have expected from Jeremiah, we
miss other things characteristic of the prophet. There is no
trace of his confident faith in the restoration of both Israel
and Judah (Jer. iii. 14-18, xxiii. 3-8, xxx.-xxxiii.), nor of his
unique doctrine of the New Covenant (Jer. xxxi. 31-34), as a
ground of hope and consolation for Zion. The only hope expressed
in Lamentations i. is the hope of Divine vengeance on
Judah&rsquo;s malicious rivals (i. 21 f.); and even this is wanting from
ch. ii. Chapter iii. finds comfort in the thought of Yahweh&rsquo;s
unfailing mercy; but ends with a louder cry for vengeance.
Chapter iv. suggests neither hope nor consolation, until the end,
where we have an assurance that Zion&rsquo;s punishment is complete,
and she will not again be exiled (iv. 21 f.). The last word is
woe for Edom. In chapter v. we have a prayer for restoration:
&ldquo;Make us return, O Yahweh, and we shall return!&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> to
our pristine state). Had Jeremiah been the author, we should
have expected something more positive and definitely prophetic
in tone and spirit. (The author of chapter iii. seems to have
felt this. It was apparently written in view of chapter ii. as a
kind of religious counterpoise to its burden of despair, which
it first takes up, verses 1-20, and then dissipates, verses 21 ff.).
(vi.) It seems almost superfluous to add that, in the brief and
troubled story of the prophet&rsquo;s life after the fall of the city
Jer. xxxix.-xliv.), it is difficult to specify an occasion when
he may be supposed to have enjoyed the necessary leisure and
quiet for the composition of these elaborate and carefully constructed
pieces, in a style so remote from his ordinary freedom
and spontaneity of utterance. And if at the very end of his
stormy career he really found time and inclination to write anything
of this nature, we may wonder why it was not included
in the considerable and somewhat miscellaneous volume of his
works, or at least mentioned in the chapters which relate to his
public activity after the catastrophe.</p>

<p>Budde&rsquo;s date, 550 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, might not be too early for chapter v.,
if it stood alone. But it was evidently written as the close of
the book, and perhaps to complete the number of five divisions,
after the model of the Pentateuch; which would bring it below
the date of Ezra (457 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). And this date is supported by
internal indications. The Divine forgetfulness has already
lasted a very long time since the catastrophe (&ldquo;for ever,&rdquo;
verse 20); which seems to imply the lapse of much more than
thirty-six years (cf. Zech. i. 12). The hill of Zion is still a
deserted site haunted by jackals, as it was when Nehemiah
arrived, 445 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (Neh. i. 3, ii. 3, 13, 17, iv. 3). And the conditions,
political and economic, seem to agree with what is told us
by Nehemiah of the state of things which he found, and which prevailed
before his coming: cf. esp. Neh. v. 2-5 with Lamentations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>129</span>
v. 2, 10, and Neh. v. 15 with Lamentations v. 5, 8. There
is nothing in chapter i. which Nehemiah himself might not have
written, had he been a poet (cf. Neh. i. 4). The narrative of
Neh. xiii. throws light on verse 10; and there are many coincidences
of language, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;The Province&rdquo; (of Judea), Neh. i.
3, cf. verse 1; &ldquo;adversaries&rdquo; (<span title="tzarim">&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;</span>), of Judah&rsquo;s hostile neighbours,
verse 7, Neh. iv. 11; &ldquo;made my strength stumble,&rdquo;
verse 14, cf. Neh. iv. 4 (Heb.); the prayers, verses 21 f., Neh.
iv. 4 f. (Heb. iii. 36 f.), are similar. The memory of what is told
in Neh. iv. 5 (11), Ezra iv. 23 f., v. 5, may perhaps have suggested
the peculiar term <span title="meshabeah">&#1502;&#1513;&#1489;&#1514;</span>, <i>stoppage</i>, <i>arrest</i>, verse 7. With verse 3
&ldquo;Judah migrated from oppression; From greatness of servitude;
She settled among the nations, Without finding a resting-place,&rdquo;
cf. Neh. v. 18 end, Jer. xl. 11 f. The &ldquo;remnant of the captivity&rdquo;
(Neh. i. 2 f.) became much attenuated (cf. verse 4), because all
who could escape from the galling tyranny of the foreigner
left the country (cf. verse 6). Verses 11, 19 (dearth of food),
20 (danger in the field, starvation in the house) agree curiously
with Neh. v. 6, 9 f.</p>

<p>Chapters ii. and iv. can hardly be dated earlier than the
beginning of the Persian period. They might then have been
written by one who, as a young man of sixteen or twenty, had
witnessed the terrible scenes of fifty years before. If, however,
as is generally recognized, these poems are not the spontaneous
and unstudied outpourings of passionate grief, but compositions
of calculated art and studied effects, written for a purpose, it
is obvious that they need not be contemporary. A poet of a
later generation might have sung of the great drama in this
fashion. The chief incidents and episodes would be deeply
graven in the popular memory; and it is the poet&rsquo;s function
to make the past live again. There is much metaphor (i. 13-15,
ii. 1-4, iii. 1-18, iv. 1 ff.), and little detail beyond the
horrors usual in long sieges (see Deut. xxviii. 52 ff.; 2 Kings
vi. 28 f.) Acquaintance with the existing literature and the
popular reminiscences of the last days of Jerusalem would supply
an ample foundation for all that we find in these poems.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAMETH, ALEXANDRE THÉODORE VICTOR,<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span> <span class="sc">Comte de</span>
(1760-1829), French soldier and politician, was born in Paris
on the 20th of October 1760. He served in the American War
of Independence under Rochambeau, and in 1789 was sent as
deputy to the States General by the nobles of the <i>bailliage</i> of
Péronne. In the Constituent Assembly he formed with Barnave
and Adrien Duport a sort of association called the &ldquo;Triumvirate,&rdquo;
which controlled a group of about forty deputies forming the
advanced left of the Assembly. He presented a famous report
in the Constituent Assembly on the organization of the army,
but is better known by his eloquent speech on the 28th of
February 1791, at the Jacobin Club, against Mirabeau, whose
relations with the court were beginning to be suspected, and who
was a personal enemy of Lameth. However, after the flight of
the king to Varennes, Lameth became reconciled with the court.
He served in the army as <i>maréchal-de-camp</i> under Luckner and
Lafayette, but was accused of treason on the 15th of August
1792, fled the country, and was imprisoned by the Austrians.
After his release he engaged in commerce at Hamburg with his
brother Charles and the duc d&rsquo;Aiguillon, and did not return to
France until the Consulate. Under the Empire he was made
prefect successively in several departments, and in 1810 was
created a baron. In 1814 he attached himself to the Bourbons,
and under the Restoration was appointed prefect of Somme,
deputy for Seine-Inférieure and finally deputy for Seine-et-Oise,
in which capacity he was a leader of the Liberal opposition.
He died in Paris on the 18th of March 1829. He was the author
of an important <i>History of the Constituent Assembly</i> (Paris,
2 vols., 1828-1829).</p>

<p>Of his two brothers, <span class="sc">Théodore Lameth</span> (1756-1854) served
in the American war, sat in the Legislative Assembly as deputy
from the department of Jura, and became <i>maréchal-de-camp</i>;
and <span class="sc">Charles Malo François Lameth</span> (1757-1832), who also
served in America, was deputy to the States General of 1789,
but emigrated early in the Revolution, returned to France
under the Consulate, and was appointed governor of Würzburg
under the Empire. Like Alexandre, Charles joined the Bourbons,
succeeding Alexandre as deputy in 1829.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAMETTRIE, JULIEN OFFRAY DE<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span> (1709-1751), French
physician and philosopher, the earliest of the materialistic
writers of the Illumination, was born at St Malo on the 25th
of December 1709. After studying theology in the Jansenist
schools for some years, he suddenly decided to adopt the
profession of medicine. In 1733 he went to Leiden to study under
Boerhaave, and in 1742 returned to Paris, where he obtained
the appointment of surgeon to the guards. During an attack
of fever he made observations on himself with reference to the
action of quickened circulation upon thought, which led him to
the conclusion that psychical phenomena were to be accounted
for as the effects of organic changes in the brain and nervous
system. This conclusion he worked out in his earliest philosophical
work, the <i>Histoire naturelle de l&rsquo;âme</i>, which appeared
about 1745. So great was the outcry caused by its publication
that Lamettrie was forced to take refuge in Leiden, where he
developed his doctrines still more boldly and completely, and
with great originality, in <i>L&rsquo;Homme machine</i> (Eng. trans.,
London, 1750; ed. with introd. and notes, J. Assézat, 1865),
and <i>L&rsquo;Homme plante</i>, treatises based upon principles of the
most consistently materialistic character. The ethics of these
principles were worked out in <i>Discours sur le bonheur</i>, <i>La
Volupté</i>, and <i>L&rsquo;Art de jouir</i>, in which the end of life is found in
the pleasures of the senses, and virtue is reduced to self-love.
Atheism is the only means of ensuring the happiness of the world,
which has been rendered impossible by the wars brought about
by theologians. The soul is only the thinking part of the body,
and with the body it passes away. When death comes, the farce
is over (<i>la farce est jouée</i>), therefore let us take our pleasure
while we can. Lamettrie has been called &ldquo;the Aristippus of
modern materialism.&rdquo; So strong was the feeling against him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>130</span>
that in 1748 he was compelled to quit Holland for Berlin, where
Frederick the Great not only allowed him to practise as a
physician, but appointed him court reader. He died on the
11th of November 1751. His collected <i>&OElig;uvres philosophiques</i>
appeared after his death in several editions, published in London,
Berlin and Amsterdam respectively.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The chief authority for his life is the <i>Éloge</i> written by Frederick the
Great (printed in Assézat&rsquo;s ed. of <i>Homme machine</i>). In modern times
Lamettrie has been judged less severely; see F. A. Lange, <i>Geschichte
des Materialismus</i> (Eng. trans. by E. C. Thomas, ii. 1880); Nérée
Quépat (<i>i.e.</i> René Paquet), <i>La Mettrie, sa vie et ses &oelig;uvres</i> (1873, with

<p><span class="bold">LAMIA,<a name="ar5" id="ar5"></a></span> in Greek mythology, queen of Libya. She was
beloved by Zeus, and when Hera robbed her of her children out
of jealousy, she killed every child she could get into her power
(Diod. Sic. xx. 41; Schol. Aristophanes, <i>Pax</i>, 757). Hence
Lamia came to mean a female bogey or demon, whose name
was used by Greek mothers to frighten their children; from
the Greek she passed into Roman demonology. She was represented
with a woman&rsquo;s face and a serpent&rsquo;s tail. She was also
known as a sort of fiend, the prototype of the modern vampire,
who in the form of a beautiful woman enticed young men to
her embraces, in order that she might feed on their life and
heart&rsquo;s blood. In this form she appears in Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Die Braut
von Corinth</i>, and Keats&rsquo;s <i>Lamia</i>. The name Lamia is clearly
the feminine form of Lamus, king of the Laestrygones (<i>q.v.</i>).
At some early period, or in some districts, Lamus and Lamia
(both, according to some accounts, children of Poseidon) were
worshipped as gods; but the names did not attain general
currency. Their history is remarkably like that of the malignant
class of demons in Germanic and Celtic folk-lore. Both names
occur in the geographical nomenclature of Greece and Asia
Minor; and it is probable that the deities belong to that religion
which spread from Asia Minor over Thrace into Greece.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LAMMAS<a name="ar6" id="ar6"></a></span> (O. Eng. <i>hlammaesse</i>, <i>hlafmaesse</i>, from <i>hlaf</i>, loaf, and
<i>maesse</i>, mass, &ldquo;loaf-mass&rdquo;), originally in England the festival
of the wheat harvest celebrated on the 1st of August, O.S. It
was one of the old quarter-days, being equivalent to midsummer,
the others being Martinmas, equivalent to Michaelmas, Candlemas
(Christmas) and Whitsuntide (Easter). Some rents are
still payable in England at Lammastide, and in Scotland it is
generally observed, but on the 12th of August, since the alteration
of the calendar in George II.&rsquo;s reign. Its name was in
allusion to the custom that each worshipper should present in
the church a loaf made of the new wheat as an offering of the
first-fruits.</p>

<p>A relic of the old &ldquo;open-field&rdquo; system of agriculture survives
in the so-called &ldquo;Lammas Lands.&rdquo; These were lands enclosed
and held in severalty during the growing of corn and grass and
thrown open to pasturage during the rest of the year for those
who had common rights. These commoners might be the
several owners, the inhabitants of a parish, freemen of a borough,
tenants of a manor, &amp;c. The opening of the fields by throwing
down the fences took place on Lammas Day (12th of August)
for corn-lands and on Old Midsummer Day (6th of July) for
grass. They remained open until the following Lady Day.
Thus, in law, &ldquo;lammas lands&rdquo; belong to the several owners in
fee-simple subject for half the year to the rights of pasturage
of other people (<i>Baylis</i> v. <i>Tyssen-Amherst</i>, 1877, 6 Ch. D., 50).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LÄMMERGEYER<a name="ar7" id="ar7"></a></span> (Ger. <i>Lämmergeier</i>, <i>Lamm</i>, lamb, and <i>Geier</i>,
vulture), or bearded vulture, the <i>Falco barbatus</i> of Linnaeus
and the <i>Gypaetus barbatus</i> of modern ornithologists, one of the
grandest birds-of-prey of the Palaearctic region&mdash;inhabiting
lofty mountain chains from Portugal to the borders of China,
though within historic times it has been exterminated in several
of its ancient haunts. Its northern range in Europe does not
seem to have extended farther than the southern frontier of
Bavaria, or the neighbourhood of Salzburg;<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> but in Asia it
formerly reached a higher latitude, having been found even so
lately as 1830 in the Amur region where, according to G. F.
Radde (<i>Beitr.</i> <i>Kenntn.</i> <i>Russ.</i> <i>Reichs</i>, xxiii. p. 467), it has now
left but its name. It is not uncommon on many parts of the
Himalayas, where it breeds; and on the mountains of Kumaon
and the Punjab, and is the &ldquo;golden eagle&rdquo; of most Anglo-Indians.
It is found also in Persia, Palestine, Crete and Greece,
the Italian Alps, Sicily, Sardinia and Mauritania.</p>

<p>In some external characters the lämmergeyer is intermediate
between the families <i>Vulturidae</i> and <i>Falconidae</i>, and the opinion
of systematists has from time to time varied as to its proper
position. It is now generally agreed, however, that it is more
closely allied with the eagles than with the vultures, and the
sub-family <i>Gypaëtinae</i> of the <i>Falconidae</i> has been formed to
contain it.</p>

<p>The whole length of the bird is from 43 to 46 in., of which,
however, about 20 are due to the long cuneiform tail, while
the pointed wings measure more than 30 in. from the carpal
joint to the tip. The top of the head is white, bounded by black,
which, beginning in stiff bristly feathers turned forwards over
the base of the beak, proceeds on either side of the face in a
well-defined band to the eye, where it bifurcates into two narrow
stripes, of which the upper one passes above and beyond that
feature till just in front of the scalp it suddenly turns upwards
across the head and meets the corresponding stripe from the
opposite side, enclosing the white forehead already mentioned,
while the lower stripe extends beneath the eye about as far
backwards and then suddenly stops. A tuft of black, bristly
feathers projects beardlike from the base of the mandible, and
gives the bird one of its commonest epithets in many languages.
The rest of the head, the neck, throat and lower parts generally
are clothed with lanceolate feathers of a pale tawny colour&mdash;sometimes
so pale as to be nearly white beneath; while the
scapulars, back and wing-coverts generally, are of a glossy
greyish-black, most of the feathers having a white shaft and a
median tawny line. The quill-feathers, both of the wings and
tail, are of a dark blackish-grey. The irides are of a light orange,
and the sclerotic tunics&mdash;equivalent to the &ldquo;white of the eye&rdquo;
in most animals&mdash;which in few birds are visible, are in this very
conspicuous and of a bright scarlet, giving it an air of great
ferocity. In the young of the year the whole head, neck and
throat are clothed in dull black, and most of the feathers of the
mantle and wing-coverts are broadly tipped and mesially
streaked with tawny or lightish-grey.</p>

<p>The lämmergeyer breeds early in the year. The nest is of
large size, built of sticks, lined with soft material and placed
on a ledge of rock&mdash;a spot being chosen, and often occupied for
many years, which is nearly always difficult of access. Here
in the month of February a single egg is usually laid. This is
more than 3 in. in length by nearly 2½ in breadth, of a pale
but lively brownish-orange. The young when in the nest are
clad in down of a dirty white, varied with grey on the head
and neck, and with ochraceous in the iliac region.</p>

<p>There is much discrepancy as to the ordinary food of the
lämmergeyer, some observers maintaining that it lives almost
entirely on carrion, offal and even ordure; but there is no
question of its frequently taking living prey, and it is reasonable
to suppose that this bird, like so many others, is not everywhere
uniform in its habits. Its name shows it to be the reputed
enemy of shepherds, and it is in some measure owing to their
hostility that it has been exterminated in so many parts of its
European range. But the lämmergeyer has also a great partiality
for bones, which when small enough it swallows. When they are
too large, it is said to soar with them to a great height and drop
them on a rock or stone that they may be broken into pieces
of convenient size. Hence its name ossifrage,<a name="fa2a" id="fa2a" href="#ft2a"><span class="sp">2</span></a> by which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>131</span>
Hebrew <i>Peres</i> is rightly translated in the Authorized Version of
the Bible (Lev. xi. 13; Deut. xiv. 12)&mdash;a word corrupted into
osprey, and applied to a bird which has no habit of the kind.</p>

<p>The lämmergeyer of north-eastern and south Africa is specifically
distinct, and is known as <i>Gypaetus meridionalis</i> or <i>G.
nudipes</i>. In habits it resembles the northern bird, from which
it differs in little more than wanting the black stripe below the
eye and having the lower part of the tarsus bare of feathers.
It is the &ldquo;golden eagle&rdquo; of Bruce&rsquo;s <i>Travels</i>, and has been
beautifully figured by Joseph Wolf in E. Rüppell&rsquo;s <i>Syst. Übers.
der Vögel Nord-Ost-Afrika&rsquo;s</i> (Taf. 1).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAMOIGNON,<a name="ar8" id="ar8"></a></span> a French family, which takes its name from
Lamoignon, a place said to have been in its possession since the
13th century. One of its several branches is that of Lamoignon
de Malesherbes. Several of the Lamoignons have played
important parts in the history of France and the family has been
specially distinguished in the legal profession. <span class="sc">Guillaume
de Lamoignon</span> (1617-1677), attained eminence as a lawyer
and became president of the parlement of Paris in 1658. First
on the popular, and later on the royalist side during the Fronde,
he presided at the earlier sittings of the trial of Fouquet, whom
he regarded as innocent, and he was associated with Colbert,
whom he was able more than once to thwart. Lamoignon
tried to simplify the laws of France and sought the society of
men of letters like Boileau and Racine. Having received rich
rewards for his public services, he died in Paris on the 10th of
December 1677. Guillaume&rsquo;s second son, <span class="sc">Nicolas de Lamoignon</span>
(1648-1724), took the surname of Basville. Following his
hereditary calling he filled many public offices, serving as intendant
of Montauban, of Pau, of Poitiers and of Languedoc before
his retirement in 1718. His administration of Languedoc was
chiefly remarkable for vigorous measures against the Camisards
and other Protestants, but in other directions his work in the
south of France was more beneficent, as, following the example
of Colbert, he encouraged agriculture and industry generally
and did something towards improving the means of communication.
He wrote a <i>Mémoire</i>, which contains much interesting
information about his public work. This was published at
Amsterdam in 1724. Lamoignon, who is called by Saint Simon,
&ldquo;the king and tyrant of Languedoc,&rdquo; died in Paris on the 17th
of May 1724. <span class="sc">Chrétien François de Lamoignon</span> (1735-1789)
entered public life at an early age and was an actor in the troubles
which heralded the Revolution. First on the side of the parlement
and later on that of the king he was one of the assistants of
Loménie de Brienne, whose unpopularity and fall he shared.
He committed suicide on the 15th of May 1789.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAMONT, JOHANN VON<a name="ar9" id="ar9"></a></span> (1805-1879), Scottish-German
astronomer and magnetician, was born at Braemar, Aberdeenshire,
on the 13th of December 1805. He was sent at the age
of twelve to be educated at the Scottish monastery in Regensburg,
and apparently never afterwards returned to his native country.
His strong bent for scientific studies was recognized by the head
of the monastery, P. Deasson, on whose recommendation he
was admitted in 1827 to the then new observatory of Bogenhausen
(near Munich), where he worked under J. Soldner.
After the death of his chief in 1835 he was, on H. C. Schumacher&rsquo;s
recommendation, appointed to succeed him as director of the
observatory. In 1852 he became professor of astronomy at
the university of Munich, and held both these posts till his death,
which took place on the 6th of August 1879. Lamont was a
member of the academies of Brussels, Upsala and Prague, of
the Royal Society of Edinburgh, of the Cambridge Philosophical
Society and of many other learned corporations. Among his
contributions to astronomy may be noted his eleven zone-catalogues
of 34,674 stars, his measurements, in 1836-1837, of
nebulae and clusters, and his determination of the mass of
Uranus from observations of its satellites (<i>Mem. Astron. Soc.</i>
xi. 51, 1838). A magnetic observatory was equipped at Bogenhausen
in 1840 through his initiative; he executed comprehensive
magnetic surveys 1849-1858; announced the magnetic
decennial period in 1850, and his discovery of earth-currents
in 1862. His <i>Handbuch des Erdmagnetismus</i> (Berlin, 1849) is
a standard work on the subject.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAMORICIÈRE, CHRISTOPHE LÉON LOUIS JUCHAULT DE<a name="ar9a" id="ar9a"></a></span>
(1806-1865), French general, was born at Nantes on the
11th of September 1806, and entered the Engineers in 1828.
He served in the Algerian campaigns from 1830 onwards, and
by 1840 he had risen to the grade of <i>maréchal-de-camp</i> (major-general).
Three years later he was made a general of division.
He was one of the most distinguished and efficient of Bugeaud&rsquo;s
generals, rendered special service at Isly (August 14, 1844),
acted temporarily as governor-general of Algeria, and finally
effected the capture of Abd el-Kader in 1847. Lamoricière
took some part in the political events of 1848, both as a member
of the Chamber of Deputies and as a military commander.
Under the régime of General Cavaignac he was for a time
minister of war. From 1848 to 1851 Lamoricière was one of
the most conspicuous opponents of the policy of Louis Napoleon,
and at the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of the 2nd of December 1851 he was
arrested and exiled. He refused to give in his allegiance to the
emperor Napoleon III., and in 1860 accepted the command
of the papal army, which he led in the Italian campaign of 1860.
On the 18th of September of that year he was severely defeated
by the Italian army at Castelfidardo. His last years were spent
in complete retirement in France (he had been allowed to return
in 1857), and he died at Prouzel (Somme) on the 11th of
September 1865.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA MOTHE LE VAYER, FRANÇOIS DE<a name="ar10" id="ar10"></a></span> (1588-1672), French
writer, was born in Paris of a noble family of Maine. His
father was an <i>avocat</i> at the parlement of Paris and author of
a curious treatise on the functions of ambassadors, entitled
<i>Legatus, seu De legatorum privilegiis, officio et munere libellus</i>
(1579) and illustrated mainly from ancient history. François
succeeded his father at the parlement, but gave up his post
about 1647 and devoted himself to travel and <i>belles lettres</i>.
His <i>Considérations sur l&rsquo;éloquence française</i> (1638) procured him
admission to the Academy, and his <i>De l&rsquo;instruction de Mgr. le
Dauphin</i> (1640) attracted the attention of Richelieu. In 1649
Anne of Austria entrusted him with the education of her second
son and subsequently with the completion of Louis XIV.&rsquo;s
education, which had been very much neglected. The outcome
of his pedagogic labours was a series of books comprising the
<i>Géographie</i>, <i>Rhétorique</i>, <i>Morale</i>, <i>Économique</i>, <i>Politique</i>, <i>Logique</i>,
and <i>Physique du prince</i> (1651-1658). The king rewarded his
tutor by appointing him historiographer of France and councillor
of state. La Mothe Le Vayer died in Paris. Modest, sceptical,
and occasionally obscene in his Latin pieces and in his verses,
he made himself a <i>persona grata</i> at the French court, where
libertinism in ideas and morals was hailed with relish. Besides
his educational works, he wrote <i>Jugement sur les anciens et
principaux historiens grecs et latins</i> (1646); a treatise entitled
<i>Du peu de certitude qu&rsquo;il y a en histoire</i> (1668), which in a sense
marks the beginning of historical criticism in France; and
sceptical <i>Dialogues</i>, published posthumously under the pseudonym
of Orosius Tubero. An incomplete edition of his works was
published at Dresden in 1756-1759.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA MOTTE, ANTOINE HOUDAR DE<a name="ar11" id="ar11"></a></span> (1672-1731), French
author, was born in Paris on the 18th of January 1672. In
1693 his comedy <i>Les Originaux</i> proved a complete failure, which
so depressed the author that he contemplated joining the
Trappists, but four years later he again began writing operas
and ballets, <i>e.g.</i> <i>L&rsquo;Europe galante</i> (1697), and tragedies, one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>132</span>
which, <i>Inès de Castro</i> (1723), was produced with immense
success at the Théâtre Français. He was a champion of the
moderns in the revived controversy of the ancients and moderns.
Madame Dacier had published (1699) a translation of the <i>Iliad</i>,
and La Motte, who knew no Greek, made a translation (1714)
in verse founded on her work. The nature of his work may be
judged from his own expression: &ldquo;I have taken the liberty
to change what I thought disagreeable in it.&rdquo; He defended the
moderns in the <i>Discours sur Homère</i> prefixed to his translation,
and in his <i>Réflexions sur la critique</i> (1716). Apart from the
merits of the controversy, it was conducted on La Motte&rsquo;s side
with a wit and politeness which compared very favourably
with his opponent&rsquo;s methods. He was elected to the Academy
in 1710, and soon after became blind. La Motte carried on a
correspondence with the duchesse du Maine, and was the friend
of Fontenelle. He had the same freedom from prejudice, the
same inquiring mind as the latter, and it is on the excellent prose
in which his views are expressed that his reputation rests. He
died in Paris on the 26th of December 1731.</p>

and violinist, was born at Bordeaux on the 28th of September
1834. He studied at the Pau Conservatoire, was engaged as
violinist at the Opéra, and in 1864 organized a series of concerts
devoted to chamber music. Having journeyed to England
and assisted at a Handel festival, he thought he would attempt
something similar in Paris. At his own expense he founded
the &ldquo;Société de l&rsquo;Harmonie Sacrée,&rdquo; and in 1873 conducted
the first performance in Paris of Handel&rsquo;s <i>Messiah</i>. He also
gave performances of Bach&rsquo;s <i>St Matthew Passion</i>, Handel&rsquo;s
<i>Judas Maccabaeus</i>, Gounod&rsquo;s <i>Gallia</i>, and Massenet&rsquo;s <i>Eve</i>. In
1875 he conducted the festival given at Rouen to celebrate the
centenary of Boïeldieu. The following year he became <i>chef
d&rsquo;orchestre</i> at the Opéra Comique. In 1881 he founded the
famous concerts associated with his name, which contributed
so much to popularize Wagner&rsquo;s music in Paris. The performances
of detached pieces taken from the German master&rsquo;s works
did not, however, satisfy him, and he matured the project to
produce <i>Lohengrin</i>, which at that time had not been heard in
Paris. For this purpose he took the Eden Theatre, and on the
3rd of May 1887 he conducted the first performance of Wagner&rsquo;s
opera in the French capital. Owing to the opposition of the
Chauvinists, the performance was not repeated; but it doubtless
prepared the way for the production of the same masterpiece
at the Paris Opéra a few years later. Lamoureux was successively
second <i>chef d&rsquo;orchestre</i> at the Conservatoire, first <i>chef d&rsquo;orchestre</i>
at the Opéra Comique, and twice first <i>chef d&rsquo;orchestre</i> at the
Opéra. He visited London on several occasions, and gave
successful concerts at the Queen&rsquo;s Hall. Lamoureux died at
Paris on the 21st of December 1899. <i>Tristan und Isolde</i> had
been at last heard in Paris, owing to his initiative and under
his direction. After conducting one of the performances of this
masterpiece he was taken ill and succumbed in a few days,
having had the consolation before his death of witnessing the
triumph of the cause he had so courageously championed.</p>

<p><i>Ancient Lamps.</i>&mdash;Though Athenaeus states (xv. 700) that the
lamp (<span class="grk" title="lychnos">&#955;&#973;&#967;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>) was not an ancient invention in Greece, it had
come into general use there for domestic purposes by the 4th
century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and no doubt had long before been employed
for temples or other places where a permanent light was required
in room of the torch of Homeric times. Herodotus (ii. 62)
sees nothing strange in the &ldquo;festival of lamps,&rdquo; Lychnokaie,
which was held at Sais in Egypt, except in the vast number of
them. Each was filled with oil so as to burn the whole night.
Again he speaks of evening as the time of lamps (<span class="grk" title="peri lychnôn">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#955;&#973;&#967;&#957;&#969;&#957;</span>,
vii. 215). Still, the scarcity of lamps in a style anything like
that of an early period, compared with the immense number of
them from the late Greek and Roman age, seems to justify
the remark of Athenaeus. The commonest sort of domestic
lamps were of terra-cotta and of the shape seen in figs. 1 and 2
with a spout or nozzle (<span class="grk" title="myktêr">&#956;&#965;&#954;&#964;&#942;&#961;</span>) in which the wick (<span class="grk" title="thryallis">&#952;&#961;&#965;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#943;&#962;</span>)
burned, a round hole on the top to pour in oil by, and a handle
to carry the lamp with. A lamp with two or more spouts was
<span class="grk" title="dimyxos">&#948;&#943;&#956;&#965;&#958;&#959;&#962;</span>, <span class="grk" title="trimyxos">&#964;&#961;&#943;&#956;&#965;&#958;&#959;&#962;</span>, &amp;c., but these terms would not apply
strictly to the large class of lamps with numerous holes for wicks
but without nozzles.
Decoration was confined
to the front of
the handle, or more
commonly to the
circular space on the
top of the lamp, and
it consisted almost
always of a design in
relief, taken from
mythology or legend,
from objects of daily
life or scenes such as
displays of gladiators
or chariot races,
from animals and
the chase. A lamp in the British Museum has a view of the
interior of a Roman circus with spectators looking on at a
chariot race. In other cases the lamp is made altogether of a
fantastic shape, as in the form of an animal, a bull&rsquo;s head, or a
human foot. Naturally colour was excluded from the ornamentation
except in the form of a red or black glaze, which would
resist the heat. The typical form of hand lamp (figs. 1, 2) is a
combination of the flatness necessary for carrying steady and
remaining steady when set down, with the roundness evolved
from the working in clay and characteristic of vessels in that
material. In the bronze lamps this same type is retained,
though the roundness was less in keeping with metal. Fanciful
shapes are equally common in bronze. The standard form of
handle consists of a ring for the forefinger and above it a kind
of palmette for the thumb. Instead of the palmette is sometimes
a crescent, no doubt in allusion to the moon. It would only be
with bronze lamps that the cover protecting the flame from
the wind could be used, as was the case out of doors in Athens.
Such a lamp was in fact a lantern. Apparently it was to the
lantern that the Greek word <i>lampas</i>, a torch, was first transferred,
probably from a custom of having guards to protect the torches
also. Afterwards it came to be employed for the lamp itself
(<span class="grk" title="lychnos">&#955;&#973;&#967;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>, <i>lucerna</i>). When Juvenal (<i>Sat.</i> iii. 277) speaks of the
<i>aenea lampas</i>, he may mean a torch with a bronze handle, but
more probably either a lamp or a lantern. Lamps used for
suspension were mostly of bronze, and in such cases the decoration
was on the under part, so as to be seen from below. Of
this the best example is the lamp at Cortona, found there in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>133</span>
1840 (engraved, <i>Monumenti d. inst. arch.</i> iii. pls. 41, 42, and in
Dennis, <i>Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria</i>, 2nd ed. ii. p. 403).
It is set round with sixteen nozzles ornamented alternately
with a siren and a satyr playing on a double flute. Between
each pair of nozzles is a head of a river god, and on the bottom
of the lamp is a large mask of Medusa, surrounded by bands of
animals. These designs are in relief, and the workmanship,
which appears to belong to the beginning of the 5th century
<span class="scs">B.C.</span>, justifies the esteem in which Etruscan lamps were held in
antiquity (Athenaeus xv. 700). Of a later but still excellent
style is a bronze lamp in the British Museum found in the baths
of Julian in Paris (figs. 3, 4, 5). The chain is attached by means
of two dolphins very artistically combined. Under the nozzles
are heads of Pan (fig. 3); and from the sides project the foreparts
of lions (fig. 5). To what
extent lamps may have been used
in temples is unknown. Probably
the Erechtheum on the acropolis
of Athens was an exception in
having a gold one kept burning
day and night, just as this lamp
itself must have been an exception
in its artistic merits. It was the
work of the sculptor Callimachus,
and was made apparently for the
newly rebuilt temple a little before
400 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> When once filled with
oil and lit it burned continuously
for a whole year. The wick
was of a fine flax called Carpasian (now understood to have been
a kind of cotton), which proved to be the least combustible of all
flax (Pausanias i. 26. 7). Above the lamp a palm tree of bronze
rose to the roof for the purpose of carrying off the fumes. But
how this was managed it is not easy to determine unless the
palm be supposed to have been inverted and to have hung above
the lamp spread out like a reflector, for which purpose the polished
bronze would have served fairly well. The stem if left hollow
would collect the fumes and carry them out through the roof.
This lamp was refilled on exactly the same day each year, so
that there seems to have been an idea of measuring time by it,
such as may also have been the case in regard to the lamp stand
(<span class="grk" title="lychneion">&#955;&#973;&#967;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>) capable of holding as many lamps as there were
days of the year, which Dionysius the Sicilian tyrant placed in
the Prytaneum of Tarentum. At Pharae in Achaia there was
in the market-place an oracular statue of Hermes with a marble
altar before it to which bronze lamps were attached by means
of lead. Whoever desired to consult the statue went there in
the evening and first filled the lamps and lit them, placing also
a bronze coin on the altar. A similar custom prevailed at the
oracle of Apis in Egypt (Pausanias vii. 22. 2). At Argos he speaks
of a chasm into which it was a custom continued to his time
to let down burning lamps, with some reference to the goddess
of the lower world, Persephone (ii. 22. 4). At Cnidus a large
number of terra-cotta lamps were found crowded in one place
a little distance below the surface, and it was conjectured that
there must have been there some statue or altar at which it had
been a custom to leave lamps burning at night (Newton, <i>Discoveries
at Halicarnassus, &amp;c.</i>, ii. 394). These lamps are of
terra-cotta, but with little ornamentation, and so like each other
in workmanship that they must all have come from one pottery,
and may have been all brought to the spot where they were
found on one occasion, probably the funeral of a person with
many friends, or the celebration of a festival in his honour,
such as the <i>parentalia</i> among the Romans, to maintain which
it was a common custom to bequeath property. For example,
a marble slab in the British Museum has a Latin inscription
describing the property which had been left to provide among
other things that a lighted lamp with incense on it should be
placed at the tomb of the deceased on the kalends, nones and
ides of each month (<i>Mus. Marbles</i>, v. pl. 8, fig. 2). For birthday
presents terra-cotta lamps appear to have been frequently
employed, the device generally being that of two figures of
victory holding between them a disk inscribed with a good
wish for the new year: <span class="scs">ANNV NOV FAVSTV FELIX</span>. This is
the inscription on a lamp in the British Museum, which besides
the victories has among other symbols a disk with the head of
Janus. As the torch gave way to the lamp in fact, so also it
gave way in mythology. In the earlier myths, as in that of
Demeter, it is a torch with which she goes forth to search for
her daughter, but in the late myth of Cupid and Psyche it is an
oil lamp which Psyche carries, and from which to her grief a
drop of hot oil falls on Cupid and awakes him. Terra-cotta
lamps have very frequently the name of the maker stamped on
the foot. Clay moulds from which the lamps were made exist
in considerable numbers.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAMPEDUSA,<a name="ar15" id="ar15"></a></span> a small island in the Mediterranean, belonging
to the province of Girgenti, from which it is about 112 m. S.S.W.
Pop. (1901, with Linosa&mdash;see below) 2276. Its greatest length is
about 7 m., its greatest width about 2 m.; the highest point
is 400 ft. above sea-level. Geologically it belongs to Africa,
being situated on the edge of the submarine platform which
extends along the east coast of Tunisia, from which (at Mahadia)
it is 90 m. distant eastwards. The soil is calcareous; it was
covered with scrub (chiefly the wild olive) until comparatively
recent times, but this has been cut, and the rock is now bare.
The valleys are, however, fairly fertile. On the south, near the
only village, is the harbour, which has been dredged to a depth
of 13 ft. and is a good one for torpedo boats and small craft.</p>

<p>The island was, as remains of hut foundations show, inhabited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>134</span>
in prehistoric times. Punic tombs and Roman buildings also
exist near the harbour. The island is the Lopadusa of Strabo,
and the Lipadosa of Ariosto&rsquo;s <i>Orlando Furioso</i>, the scene of the
landing of Roger of Sicily and of his conversion by the hermit.
A thousand slaves were taken from its population in 1553.
In 1436 it was given by Alfonso of Aragon to Don Giovanni
de Caro, baron of Montechiaro. In 1661, Ferdinand Tommasi,
its then owner, received the title of prince from Charles II. of
Spain. In 1737 the earl of Sandwich found only one inhabitant
upon it; in 1760 some French settlers established themselves
there. Catherine II. of Russia proposed to buy it as a Russian
naval station, and the British government thought of doing
the same if Napoleon had succeeded in seizing Malta. In 1800
a part of it was leased to Salvatore Gatt of Malta, who in 1810
sublet part of it to Alessandro Fernandez. In 1843 onwards
Ferdinand II. of Naples established a colony there. There is
now an Italian penal colony for <i>domicilio coatto</i>, with some 400
convicts (see B. Sanvisente, <i>L&rsquo;Isola di Lampedusa eretta a
colonia</i>, Naples, 1849). Eight miles W. is the islet of Lampione.
Linosa, some 30 m. to the N.N.E., measures about 2 by 2 m.,
and is entirely volcanic; its highest point is 610 ft. above sea-level.
Pop. (1901) about 200. It has landing-places on the S.
and W., and is more fertile than Lampedusa; but it suffers from
the lack of springs. Sanvisente says the water in Lampedusa
is good. A few fragments of undoubtedly Roman pottery and
some Roman coins have been found there, but the cisterns and
the ruins of houses are probably of later date (P. Calcara,
<i>Descrizione dell&rsquo; isola di Linosa</i>, Palermo, 1851, 29).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAMPETER<a name="ar17" id="ar17"></a></span> (<i>Llanbedr-pont-Stephan</i>), a market town, municipal
borough and assize town of Cardiganshire, Wales, on
the right bank of the Teifi, here crossed by an ancient stone
bridge. Pop. (1901) 1722. Lampeter is a station on the so-called
Manchester-and-Milford branch line of the Great Western
railway. Though of ancient origin, the town is entirely modern
in appearance, its most conspicuous object being the Gothic
buildings of St David&rsquo;s College, founded in 1822, which cover
a large area and contain a valuable library of English, Welsh
and foreign works (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Universities</a></span>). The modernized parish
church of St Peter, or Pedr, contains some old monuments of
the Lloyd family. North of the town are the park and mansion
of Falcondale, the seat of the Harford family.</p>

<p>The name of Llanbedr-pont-Stephan goes to prove the early
foundation of the place by St Pedr, a Celtic missionary of the
6th century, while one Stephen was the original builder of the
bridge over the Teifi. As an important outpost in the upper
valley of the Teifi, Lampeter possessed a castle, which was
demolished by Owen Gwynedd in the 12th century. In 1188
the town was visited by Archbishop Baldwin on his way from
Cardigan to Strata-Florida Abbey, and the Crusade was vigorously
preached at this spot. Lampeter was first <span class="correction" title="amended from imcorporated">incorporated</span>
under Edward II., but the earliest known charter dates from
the reign of Henry VI., whereby the principal officer of the town,
a portreeve, was to be appointed annually at the court-leet of
the manor. The town was subsequently governed under a
confirmatory charter of 1814, but in 1884 a new charter was
obtained, whereby the corporation was empowered to consist
of a mayor, 4 aldermen and 12 councillors. Although only a
small agricultural centre, Lampeter has since 1886 become the
assize town of Cardiganshire owing to its convenient position.
Until the Redistribution Act of 1885 Lampeter formed one of
the group of boroughs comprising the Cardigan parliamentary
district.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAMPOON,<a name="ar18" id="ar18"></a></span> a virulent satire either in prose or verse; the
idea of injustice and unscrupulousness seems to be essential
to its definition. Although in its use the word is properly and
almost exclusively English, the derivation appears to be French.
Littré derives it from a term of Parisian argot, <i>lamper</i>, to drink,
greedily, in great mouthfuls. This word appears to have begun
to be prevalent in the middle of the 17th century, and Furetière
has preserved a fragment from a popular song, which says:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>Jacques fuyant de Dublin</p>
<p>Dit à Lauzun, son cousin,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prenez soin de ma couronne,</p>
<p>J&rsquo;aurai soin de ma personne,</p>
      <p class="i2">Lampons! lampons!&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">&mdash;that is to say, let us drink heavily, and begone dull care.
Scarron speaks of a wild troop, singing <i>leridas</i> and <i>lampons</i>.
There is, also, a rare French verb, <i>lamponner</i>, to attack with
ridicule, used earlier in the 17th century by Brantôme. In its
English form, lampoon, the word is used by Evelyn in 1645,
&ldquo;Here they still paste up their drolling lampoons and scurrilous
papers,&rdquo; and soon after it is a verb,&mdash;&ldquo;suppose we lampooned
all the pretty women in Town.&rdquo; Both of these forms, the noun
and the verb, have been preserved ever since in English, without
modification, for violent and reckless literary censure. Tom
Brown (1663-1704) was a past master in the art of lampooning,
and some of his attacks on the celebrities of his age have a
certain vigour. When Dryden became a Roman Catholic, Brown
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg 90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>Traitor to God and rebel to thy pen,</p>
<p>Priest-ridden Poet, perjured son of Ben,</p>
<p>If ever thou prove honest, then the nation</p>
<p>May modestly believe in transubstantiation.</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>Several of the heroes of the <i>Dunciad</i>, and in particular John
Oldmixon (1673-1742), were charged without unfairness with
being professional lampooners. The coarse diatribes which were
published by Richard Savage (1697-1743), mainly against Lady
Macclesfield, were nothing more nor less than lampoons, and
the word may with almost equal justice be employed to describe
the coarser and more personal portions of the satires of Churchill.
As a rule, however, the lampoon possessed no poetical graces,
and in its very nature was usually anonymous. The notorious
<i>Essay on Woman</i> (1764) of John Wilkes was a lampoon, and
was successfully proceeded against as an obscene libel. The
progress of civilization and the discipline of the law made it
more and more impossible for private malice to take the form
of baseless and scurrilous attack, and the lampoon, in its open
shape, died of public decency in the 18th century. Malice,
especially in an anonymous form, and passing in manuscript
from hand to hand, has continued, however, to make use of this
very unlovely form of literature. It has constantly reappeared
at times of political disturbance, and the French have seldom
failed to exercise their wicked wit upon their unpopular rulers.

<p><span class="bold">LAMPREY,<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span> a fish belonging to the family <i>Petromyzontidae</i>
(from <span class="grk" title="petros">&#960;&#941;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span> and <span class="grk" title="myzô">&#956;&#973;&#950;&#969;</span>, literally, stone-suckers), which with the
hag-fishes or <i>Myxinidae</i> forms a distinct subclass of fishes,
the <i>Cyclostomata</i>, distinguished by the low organization of their
skeleton, which is cartilaginous, without vertebral segmentation,
without ribs or real jaws, and without limbs. The lampreys
are readily recognized by their long, eel-like, scaleless body,
terminating anteriorly in the circular, suctorial mouth characteristic
of the whole sub-class. On each side, behind the head,
there is a row of seven branchial openings, through which the
water is conveyed to and from the gills. By means of their
mouth they fasten to stones, boats, &amp;c., as well as to other
fishes, their object being to obtain a resting-place on the former,
whilst they attach themselves to the latter to derive nourishment
from them. The inner surface of their cup-shaped mouth is
armed with pointed teeth, with which they perforate the integuments
of the fish attacked, scraping off particles of the flesh
and sucking the blood. Mackerel, cod, pollack and flat-fishes
are the kinds most frequently attacked by them in the sea;
of river-fish the migratory <i>Salmonidae</i> and the shad are sometimes
found with the marks of the teeth of the lamprey, or with
the fish actually attached to them. About fifteen species are
known from the coasts and rivers of the temperate regions of
the northern and southern hemispheres. In Great Britain and
Europe generally three species occur, viz. the large spotted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>135</span>
sea-lamprey (<i>Petromyzon marinus</i>), the river-lamprey or
lampern (<i>P. fluviatilis</i>), and the small lampern or &ldquo;pride&rdquo;
or &ldquo;sand-piper&rdquo; (<i>P. branchialis</i>). The first two are migratory,
entering rivers in the spring to spawn; of the river-lamprey,
however, specimens are met with in fresh water all the year
round. In North America about ten species of lamprey occur,
while in South America and Australasia still others are found.
Lampreys, especially the sea-lamprey, are esteemed as food,
formerly more so than at present; but their flesh is not easy
of digestion. Henry I. of England is said to have fallen a victim
to this, his favourite dish. The species of greatest use is the
river-lamprey, which as bait is preferred to all others in the
cod and turbot fisheries of the North Sea. Yarrell states that
formerly the Thames alone supplied from 1,000,000 to 1,200,000
lamperns annually, but their number has so much fallen off
that, for instance, in 1876 only 40,000 were sold to the cod-fishers.
That year, however, was an unusually bad year; the
lamperns, from their scarcity, fetched £8, 10s. a thousand,
whilst in ordinary years £5 is considered a fair price. The season
for catching lamperns closes in the Thames about the middle
of March. The origin of the name lamprey is obscure; it is an
adaptation of Fr. <i>lamproie</i>, Med. Lat. <i>lampreda</i>; this has been
taken as a variant of another Med. Lat. form <i>Lampetra</i>, which
occurs in ichthyological works of the middle ages; the derivation
from <i>lambere petras</i>, to lick stones, is a specimen of etymological
ingenuity. The development of lampreys has received much
attention on the part of naturalists, since Aug. Müller discovered
that they undergo a metamorphosis, and that the minute
worm-like lamperns previously known under the name of
<i>Ammocoetes</i>, and abundant in the sand and mud of many streams,
were nothing but the undeveloped young of the river-lampreys
and small lamperns. See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cyclostomata</a></span>.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LAMPROPHYRES<a name="ar20" id="ar20"></a></span> (from Gr. <span class="grk" title="lampros">&#955;&#945;&#956;&#960;&#961;&#972;&#962;</span>, bright, and the terminal
part of the word porphyry, meaning rocks containing bright
porphyritic crystals), a group of rocks containing phenocrysts,
usually of biotite and hornblende (with bright cleavage surfaces),
often also of olivine and augite, but not of felspar. They are
thus distinguished from the porphyries and porphyrites in which
the felspar has crystallized in two generations. They are essentially
&ldquo;dike rocks,&rdquo; occurring as dikes and thin sills, and are
also found as marginal facies of plutonic intrusions. They furnish
a good example of the correlation which often exists between
petrographical types and their mode of occurrence, showing
the importance of physical conditions in determining the mineralogical
and structural characters of rocks. They are usually
dark in colour, owing to the abundance of ferro-magnesian
silicates, of relatively high specific gravity and liable to decomposition.
For these reasons they have been defined as a <i>melanocrate</i>
series (rich in the dark minerals); and they are often
accompanied by a complementary <i>leucocrate</i> series (rich in the
white minerals felspar and quartz) such as aplites, porphyries
and felsites. Both have been produced by differentiation of
a parent magma, and if the two complementary sets of rocks
could be mixed in the right proportions, it is presumed that a
mass of similar chemical composition to the parent magma
would be produced.</p>

<p>Both in the hand specimens and in microscopic slides of
lamprophyric rocks biotite and hornblende are usually conspicuous.
Though black by reflected light they are brown by
transmitted light and highly pleochroic. In some cases they
are yellow-brown, in other cases chestnut-brown and reddish
brown; in the same rock the two minerals have strikingly
similar colour and pleochroism. Augite, when it occurs, is
sometimes green, at other times purple. Felspar is restricted
to the ground mass; quartz occurs sometimes but is scarce.
Although porphyritic structure is almost universal, it is sometimes
not very marked. The large biotites and hornblendes
are not sharply distinct from those of intermediate size, which
in turn graduate into the small crystals of the same minerals
in the ground mass. As a rule all the ingredients have rather
perfect crystalline forms (except quartz), hence these rocks have
been called &ldquo;panidiomorphic.&rdquo; In many lamprophyres the pale
quartz and felspathic ingredients tend to occur in rounded
spots, or <i>ocelli</i>, in which there has been progressive crystallization
from the margins towards the centre. These spots may
consist of radiate or brush-like felspars (with some mica and
hornblende) or of quartz and felspar. A central area of quartz
or of analcite probably represents an original miarolitic cavity
infilled at a later period.</p>

<p>There are two great groups of lamprophyres differing in composition
while retaining the general features of the class. One
of these accompanies intrusions of granite and diorite and
includes the minettes, kersantites, vogesites and spessartites.
The other is found in association with nepheline syenites,
essexites and teschenites, and is exemplified by camptonites,
monchiquites and alnoites. The complementary facies of the
first group is the aplites, porphyrites and felsites; that of the
second group includes bostonites, tinguaites and other rocks.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The <i>granito-dioritic-lamprophyres</i> (the first of these two groups) are
found in many districts where granites and diorites occur, <i>e.g.</i> the
Scottish Highlands and Southern Uplands, the Lake district, Ireland,
the Vosges, Black Forest, Harz, &amp;c. As a rule they do not proceed
directly from the granite, but form separate dikes which may be
later than, and consequently may cut, the granites and diorites.
In other districts where granites are abundant no rocks of this class
are known. It is rare to find only one member of the group present,
but minettes, vogesites, kersantites, &amp;c., all appear and there are
usually transitional forms. For this reason these rock species must
not be regarded as sharply distinct from one another. The group
as a whole is a well-characterized one and shows few transitions to
porphyries, porphyrites and other dike types; its subdivisions,
however, tend to merge into one another and especially when they
are weathered are hard to differentiate. The presence or absence of
the four dominant minerals, orthoclase, plagioclase, biotite and
hornblende, determines the species. Minettes contain biotite and
orthoclase; kersantites, biotite and plagioclase. Vogesites contain
hornblende and orthoclase; spessartites, hornblende and plagioclase.
Each variety of lamprophyre may and often does contain
all four minerals but is named according to the two which preponderate.
These rocks contain also iron oxides (usually titaniferous),
apatite, sometimes sphene, augite and olivine. The hornblende
and biotite are brown or greenish brown, and as a rule their crystals
even when small are very perfect and give the micro-sections an
easily recognizable character. Green hornblende occurs in some of
these rocks. The augite builds eumorphic crystals of pale green
colour, often zonal and readily weathering. Olivine in the fresh
state is rare; it forms rounded, corroded grains; in many cases it
is decomposed to green or colourless hornblende in radiating nests
(pilite). The plagioclase occurs as small rectangular crystals;
orthoclase may have similar shapes or may be fibrous and grouped in
sheaflike aggregates which are narrow in the middle and spread out
towards both ends. If quartz is present it is the last product of
crystallization and the only mineral devoid of idiomorphism; it fills
up the spaces between the other ingredients of the rock. As all
lamprophyres are prone to alteration by weathering a great abundance
of secondary minerals is usually found in them; the principal
are calcite and other carbonates, limonite, chlorite, quartz and
kaolin.</p>

<p>Ocellar structure is common; the ocelli consist mainly of orthoclase
and quartz, and may be a quarter of an inch in diameter.
Another feature of these rocks is the presence of large foreign crystals
or xenocrysts of felspar and of quartz. Their forms are rounded,
indicating partial resorption by the solvent action of the lamprophyric
magma; and the quartz may be surrounded by corrosion borders of
minerals such as augite and hornblende produced where the magma
is attacking the crystal. These crystals are of doubtful origin; they
are often of considerable size and may be conspicuous in hand-specimens
of the rocks. It is supposed that they did not crystallize
in the lamprophyre dike but in some way were caught up by it.
Other enclosures, more certainly of foreign origin, are often seen, such
as quartzite, schists, garnetiferous rocks, granite, &amp;c. These may
be baked and altered or in other cases partly dissolved. Cordierite
may be formed either in the enclosure or in the lamprophyre, where
it takes the shape of hexagonal prisms which in polarized light break
up into six sectors, triangular in shape, diverging from the centre of
the crystal.</p>

<p>The second group of lamprophyric dike rocks (<i>the camptonite,
monchiquite, alnoite series</i>) is much less common than those above
described. As a rule they occur together, and there are transitions
between the different sub-groups as in the granito-dioritic lamprophyres.
In Sweden, Brazil, Portugal, Norway, the north of Scotland,
Bohemia, Arkansas and other places this assemblage of rock types
has been met with, always presenting nearly identical features. In
most cases, though not in all, they have a close association with
nepheline or leucite syenites and similar rocks rich in alkalies. This
indicates a genetic affinity like that which exists between the granites
and the minettes, &amp;c., and further proof of this connexion is furnished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>136</span>
by the occasional occurrence in those lamprophyres of leucite, haüyne
and other felspathoid minerals.</p>

<p>The camptonites (called after Campton, New Hampshire) are dark
brown, nearly black rocks often with large hornblende phenocrysts.
Their essential minerals in thin section are hornblende of a strong
reddish-brown colour; augite purple, pleochroic and rich in titanium,
olivine and plagioclase felspar. They have the porphyritic and
panidiomorphic structures described in the rocks of the previous
group, and like them also have an ocellar character, often very conspicuous
under the microscope. The accessory minerals are biotite,
apatite, iron oxides and analcite. They decompose readily and are
then filled with carbonates. Many of these rocks prove on analysis
to be exceedingly rich in titanium; they may contain 4 or 5% of
titanium dioxide.</p>

<p>The monchiquites (called after the Serra de Monchique, Portugal)
are fine-grained and devoid of felspar. Their essential constituents
are olivine and purplish augite. Brown hornblende, like that of the
camptonites, occurs in many of them. An interstitial substance is
present, which may sometimes be a brown glass, but at other times
is colourless and is believed by some petrographers to be primary
crystalline analcite. They would define the monchiquites as rocks
consisting of olivine, augite and analcite; others regard the analcite
as secondary, and consider the base as essentially glassy. Some
monchiquites contain haüyne; while in others small leucites are
found. Ocellar structure is occasionally present, though less marked
than in the camptonites. A special group of monchiquites rich in
deep brown biotite has been called fourchites (after the Fourche
Mountains, Arkansas).</p>

<p>The alnoites (called after the island of Alnö in Norway) are rare
rocks found in Norway, Montreal and other parts of North America
and in the north of Scotland. They contain olivine, augite, brown
biotite and melilite. They are free from felspar, and contain very
low percentages of silica.</p>

<p>The chemical composition of some of these rocks will be indicated
by the analyses of certain well-known examples.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAMPSACUS,<a name="ar21" id="ar21"></a></span> an ancient Greek colony in Mysia, Asia Minor,
known as Pityusa or Pityussa before its colonization by Ionian
Greeks from Phocaea and Miletus, was situated on the Hellespont,
opposite Callipolis (Gallipoli) in Thrace. It possessed a good
harbour; and the neighbourhood was famous for its wine, so
that, having fallen into the hands of the Persians during the Ionian
revolt, it was assigned by Artaxerxes I. to Themistocles to provide
him with wine, as Percote did with meat and Magnesia with
bread. After the battle of Mycale (479 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Lampsacus joined
the Athenians, but, having revolted from them in 411, was
reduced by force. It was defended in 196 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> against Antiochus
the Great of Syria, after which its inhabitants were received
as allies of Rome. Lampsacus was the chief seat of the worship
of Priapus, a gross nature-god closely connected with the culture
of the vine. The ancient name is preserved in that of the modern
village of Lapsaki, but the Greek town possibly lay at Chardak
immediately opposite Gallipoli.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANARK,<a name="ar23" id="ar23"></a></span> a royal, municipal and police burgh, and county
town of Lanarkshire, Scotland, standing on high ground about
half a mile from the right bank of the Clyde, 31 m. S.E. of
Glasgow by the Caledonian railway. Pop. (1901) 6440. It is
a favourite holiday resort, being the point from which the falls
of the Clyde are usually visited. The principal buildings are
the town hall, the county buildings, the assembly rooms, occupying
the site of an old Franciscan monastery, three hospitals, a
convalescent home, the Smyllum orphanage and the Queen
Victoria Jubilee fountain. The industries include cotton-spinning,
weaving, nail-making and oilworks, and there are frequent
markets for cattle and sheep. Lanark is a place of considerable
antiquity. Kenneth II. held a parliament here in 978, and it
was sometimes the residence of the Scottish kings, one of whom,
William the Lion (d. 1214), granted it a charter. Several of
the earlier exploits of William Wallace were achieved in the
neighbourhood. He burned the town and slew the English
sheriff William Hezelrig. About 1 m. N.W. are Cartland
Craigs, where Mouse Water runs through a precipitous red
sandstone ravine, the sides of which are about 400 ft. high.
The stream is crossed by a bridge of single span, supposed to be
Roman, and by a three-arched bridge, designed by Thomas
Telford and erected in 1823. On the right bank, near this bridge,
is the cave in which Wallace concealed himself after killing
Hezelrig and which still bears his name. Lanark was the centre
of much activity in the days of the Covenanters. William Lithgow
(1582-1645), the traveller, William Smellie (1697-1763), the
obstetrician and Gavin Hamilton (1730-1797), the painter,
were born at Lanark. The town is one of the Falkirk district
group of parliamentary burghs, the other constituents being
Airdrie, Hamilton, Falkirk and Linlithgow.</p>

<p>New Lanark (pop. 795), 1 m. S., is famous in connexion
with the socialist experiments of Robert Owen. The village
was founded by David Dale (1739-1806) in 1785, with the support
of Sir Richard Arkwright, inventor of the spinning-frame, who
thought the spot might be made the Manchester of Scotland.
In ten years four cotton mills were running, employing nearly
1400 hands. They were sold in 1799 to a Manchester company,
who appointed Owen manager. In the same year he married
Dale&rsquo;s daughter. For many years the mills were successfully
conducted, but friction ultimately arose and Owen retired in
1828. The mills, however, are still carried on.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>There are several interesting places near Lanark. Braxfield, on
the Clyde, gave the title of Lord Braxfield to Robert Macqueen (1722-1799),
who was born in the mansion and acquired on the bench the
character of the Scottish Jeffreys. Robert Baillie, the patriot who
was executed for conscience&rsquo; sake (1684), belonged to Jerviswood, an
estate on the Mouse. Lee House, the home of the Lockharts, is 3 m.
N.W. The old castle was largely rebuilt in the 19th century. It
contains some fine tapestry and portraits, and the Lee Penny&mdash;familiar
to readers of Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s <i>Talisman</i>&mdash;which was brought
from Palestine in the 14th century by the Crusading knight, Sir
Simon Lockhart. It is described as a cornelian encased in a silver
coin. Craignethan Castle on the Nethan, a left-hand tributary joining
the Clyde at Crossford, is said to be the original of the &ldquo;Tillietudiem&rdquo;
of Scott&rsquo;s <i>Old Mortality</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANARKSHIRE,<a name="ar24" id="ar24"></a></span> a south-western county of Scotland,
bounded N. by the shires of Dumbarton and Stirling, E. by
Linlithgowshire, Mid-Lothian and Peeblesshire, S. by Dumfriesshire
and W. by the counties of Ayr, Renfrew and Dumbarton.
Its area is 879 sq. m. (562,821 acres). It may be described as
embracing the valley of the Clyde; and, in addition to the gradual
descent from the high land in the south, it is also characterized
by a gentle slope towards both banks of the river. The shire is
divided into three wards, the Upper, comprising all the southern
section, or more than half the whole area (over 330,000 acres);
the Middle, with Hamilton for its chief town, covering fully
190,000 acres; and the Lower, occupying the northern area
of about 40,000 acres. The surface falls gradually from the
uplands in the south to the Firth of Clyde. The highest hills
are nearly all on or close to the borders of Peeblesshire and
Dumfriesshire, and include Culter Fell (2454 ft.) and Lowther
Hill (2377). The loftiest heights exclusively belonging to
Lanarkshire are Green Lowther (2403), Tinto (2335), Ballencleuch
Law (2267), Rodger Law (2257), Dun Law (2216), Shiel
Dod (2190), Dungrain Law (2186) and Comb Law (2107).
The principal rivers are the Clyde and its head waters and
affluents (on the right, the Medwin, Mouse, South Calder, North
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>137</span>
Calder and Kelvin; on the left, the Douglas, Nethan, Avon,
Rotten Calder and Cart). There are no lochs of considerable
size, the few sheets of water in the north&mdash;Woodend Reservoir,
Bishop Loch, Hogganfield Loch, Woodend Loch, Lochend
Loch&mdash;mainly feeding the Monkland and the Forth and Clyde
Canals. The most famous natural features are the Falls of
Clyde at Bonnington, Corra, Dundaff and Stonebyres.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;The southern upland portion is built up of Silurian and
Ordovician rocks; the northern lower-lying tracts are formed of
Carboniferous and Old Red Sandstone rocks. Ordovician strata
cross the county from S.W. to N.E. in a belt 5-7 m. in breadth which
is brought up by a fault against the Old Red and the Silurian on
the northern side. This fault runs by Lamington, Roberton and
Crawfordjohn. The Ordovician rocks lie in a synclinal fold with
beds of Caradoc age in the centre flanked by graptolitic shales,
grits and conglomerates, including among the last-named the local
&ldquo;Haggis-rock&rdquo;; the well-known lead mines of Leadhills are worked
in these formations. Silurian shales and sandstones, &amp;c., extend
south of the Ordovician belt to the county boundary; and again, on
the northern side of the Ordovician belt two small tracts appear
through the Old Red Sandstone on the crests of anticlinal folds.
The Old Red Sandstone covers an irregular tract north of the Ordovician
belt; a lower division consisting of sandstone, conglomerates
and mud-stones is the most extensively developed; above this is
found a series of contemporaneous porphyrites and melaphyres, conformable
upon the lower division in the west of the county but are not
so in the east. An upper series of sandstones and grits is seen for
a short distance west of Lamington. Lanark stands on the Old Red
Sandstone and the Falls of Clyde occur in the same rocks. Economically
the most important geological feature is the coal basin of the
Glasgow district. The axis of this basin lies in a N.E.-S.W. direction;
in the central part, including Glasgow, Airdrie, Motherwell,
Wishaw, Carluke, lie the coal-measures, consisting of sandstones,
shales, marls and fireclays with seams of coal and ironstone. There
are eleven beds of workable coal, the more important seams being
the Ell, Main, Splint, Pyotshaw and Virtuewell. Underlying the
coal-measures is the Millstone Grit seen on the northern side between
Glenboig and Hogganfield&mdash;here the fireclays of Garnkirk, Gartcosh
and Glenboig are worked&mdash;and on the south and south-east of the
coal-measures, but not on the western side, because it is there cut out
by a fault. Beneath the last-named formation comes the Carboniferous
Limestone series with thin coals and ironstones, and again
beneath this is the Calciferous Sandstone series which in the south-east
consists of sandstones, shales, &amp;c., but in the west the greater
part of the series is composed of interbedded volcanic rocks&mdash;porphyrites
and melaphyres. It will be observed that in general the
younger formations lie nearer the centre of the basin and the older
ones crop out around them. Besides the volcanic rocks mentioned
there are intrusive basalts in the Carboniferous rocks like that in the
neighbourhood of Shotts, and the smaller masses at Hogganfield near
Glasgow and elsewhere. Volcanic necks are found in the Carluke and
Kilcadzow districts, marking the vents of former volcanoes and
several dikes of Tertiary age traverse the older rocks. An intrusion
of pink felsite in early Old Red times has been the cause of Tinto
Hill. Evidences of the Glacial period are abundant in the form of
kames and other deposits of gravel, sand and boulder clay. The ice
in flowing northward and southward from the higher ground took
an easterly direction when it reached the lower ground. In the lower
reaches of the Clyde the remains of old beaches at 25, 50 and 100 ft.
above the present sea-level are to be observed.</p>

<p><i>Climate and Agriculture.</i>&mdash;The rainfall averages 42 in. annually,
being higher in the hill country and lower towards the north. The
temperature for the year averages 48° F., for January 38° and for
July 59°. The area under grain has shown a downward tendency
since 1880. Oats is the principal crop, but barley and wheat are
also grown. Potatoes and turnips are raised on a large scale. In
the Lower Ward market-gardening has increased considerably, and
the quantity of vegetables, grapes and tomatoes reared under glass
has reached great proportions. An ancient industry in the vale of
the Clyde for many miles below Lanark is the cultivation of fruit,
several of the orchards being said to date from the time of Bede.
The apples and pears are of good repute. There has been a remarkable
extension in the culture of strawberries, hundreds of acres being
laid down in beds. The sheep walks in the upper and middle wards
are heavily stocked and the herds of cattle are extensive, the favoured
breeds being Ayrshire and a cross between this and &ldquo;improved
Lanark.&rdquo; Dairy-farming flourishes, the cheeses of Carnwath and
Lesmahagow being in steady demand. Clydesdale draught-horses are
of high class. They are supposed to have been bred from Flanders
horses imported early in the 18th century by the 5th duke of
Hamilton. Most of the horses are kept for agricultural work, but
a considerable number of unbroken horses and mares are maintained
for stock. Pigs are numerous, being extensively reared by the
miners. The largest farms are situated in the Upper Ward, but the
general holding runs from 50 to 100 acres. More than 21,000 acres
are under wood.</p>

<p><i>Other Industries.</i>&mdash;The leading industries are those in connexion
with the rich and extensive coal and iron field to the east and southeast
of Glasgow; the shipbuilding at Govan and Partick and in
Glasgow harbour; the textiles at Airdrie, Blantyre, Hamilton,
Lanark, New Lanark, Rutherglen and Glasgow; engineering at
Cambuslang, Carluke, Coatbridge, Kinning Park, Motherwell and
Wishaw, and the varied and flourishing manufactures centred in
and around Glasgow.</p>

<p><i>Communications.</i>&mdash;In the north of the county, where population is
most dense and the mineral field exceptionally rich, railway facilities
are highly developed, there being for 10 or 12 m. around Glasgow
quite a network of lines. The Caledonian Railway Company&rsquo;s main
line to the south runs through the whole length of the shire, sending
off branches at several points, especially at Carstairs Junction.
The North British Railway Company serves various towns in the
lower and middle wards and its lines to Edinburgh cross the northwestern
corner and the north of the county. Only in the immediate
neighbourhood of Glasgow does the Glasgow and South Western
system compete for Lanarkshire traffic, though it combines with the
Caledonian to work the Mid-Lanarkshire and Ayrshire railway.
The Monkland Canal in the far north and the Forth and Clyde Canal
in the north and north-west carry a considerable amount of goods,
and before the days of railways afforded one of the principal means
of communication between east and west.</p>

<p><i>Population and Administration.</i>&mdash;The population amounted in
1891 to 1,105,899 and in 1901 to 1,339,327, or 1523 persons to the
sq. m. Thus though only tenth in point of extent, it is much the
most populous county in Scotland, containing within its bounds
nearly one-third of the population of the country. In 1901 there
were 104 persons speaking Gaelic only, and 26,905 speaking Gaelic
and English. The chief towns, with populations in 1901, apart from
Glasgow, are Airdrie (22,288), Cambuslang (12,252), Coatbridge
(36,991), Govan (82,174), Hamilton (32,775), Kinning Park (13,852),
Larkhall (11,879), Motherwell (30,418), Partick (54,298), Rutherglen
(17,220), Shettleston (12,154), Wishaw (20,873). Among smaller
towns are Bellshill, Carluke, Holytown, Lanark, Stonefield, Tollcross
and Uddingston; and Lesmahagow and East Kilbride are
populous villages and mining centres. The county is divided into
six parliamentary divisions:&mdash;North-east, North-west, Mid and
South Lanark, Govan and Partick each returning one member.
The royal burghs are Glasgow, Lanark and Rutherglen; the
municipal and police burghs Airdrie, Biggar, Coatbridge, Glasgow,
Govan, Hamilton, Kinning Park, Lanark, Motherwell, Partick,
Rutherglen and Wishaw. Glasgow returns seven members to Parliament;
Airdrie, Hamilton and Lanark belong to the Falkirk group
and Rutherglen to the Kilmarnock group of parliamentary burghs.
Lanarkshire is a sheriffdom, whose sheriff-principal is confined to his
judicial duties in the county, and he has eight substitutes, five of
whom sit constantly in Glasgow, and one each at Airdrie, Hamilton
and Lanark. The shire is under school-board jurisdiction, many
schools earning grants for higher education. For advanced education,
besides the university and many other institutions in Glasgow
there are a high school in Hamilton, and technical schools at Coatbridge
and Wishaw. The county council expends the &ldquo;residue&rdquo;
grant in supporting lectures and classes in agriculture and agricultural
chemistry, mining, dairying, cookery, laundry work, nursery
and poultry-keeping, in paying fees and railway fares and providing
bursaries for technical students, and in subsidizing science
and art and technical classes in day and evening schools. A director
of technical education is maintained by the council. Lanark,
Motherwell and Biggar entrust their shares of the grant to the
county council, and Coatbridge and Airdrie themselves subsidize
science and art and evening classes and continuation schools.</p>
</div>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;At an early period Lanarkshire was inhabited by
a Celtic tribe, the Damnonii, whose territory was divided by
the wall of Antoninus between the Forth and Clyde (remains
of which are found in the parish of Cadder), but who were never
wholly subjugated by the Romans. Traces of their fortifications,
mounds and circles exist, while stone axes, bronze celts, querns
and urns belonging to their age are occasionally unearthed.
Of the Romans there are traces in the camp on Beattock summit
near Elvanfoot, in the fine bridge over the Mouse near Lanark,
in the road to the south of Strathaven, in the wall already
mentioned and in the coins and other relics that have been dug
up. After their departure the country which included Lanarkshire
formed part of the kingdom of Strathclyde, which, in the
7th century, was subdued by Northumbrian Saxons, when great
numbers of the Celts migrated into Wales. The county once
embraced a portion of Renfrewshire, but this was disjoined in
the time of Robert III. The shire was then divided into two
wards, the Over (with Lanark as its chief town) and the Nether
(with Rutherglen as its capital). The present division into three
wards was not effected till the 18th century. Independently
of Glasgow, Lanarkshire has not borne any part continuously
in the general history of Scotland, but has been the scene of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>138</span>
several exciting episodes. Many of Wallace&rsquo;s daring deeds were
performed in the county, Queen Mary met her fate at Langside
(1568) and the Covenanters received constant support from
the people, defeating Claverhouse at Drumclog (1679), but
suffering defeat themselves at Bothwell Brig (1679).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANCASHIRE,<a name="ar25" id="ar25"></a></span> a north-western county of England, bounded
N.E. by Westmorland, E. by Yorkshire, S. by Cheshire, W.
by the Irish Sea and N.W. by Cumberland. The area is 1880.2
sq. m., the county being the sixth in size in England. The coast
is generally flat, and broken by great inlets, with wide expanses
of sandy foreshore at low tide. The chief inlets, from N. to S.,
are&mdash;the estuary of the river Duddon, which, with the river
itself, separates the county from Cumberland; Morecambe
Bay; and the estuaries of the Ribble and the Mersey.
Morecambe Bay receives the rivers Crake and Leven in a common
estuary, and the Kent from Westmorland; while the Lune and
the Wyre discharge into Lancaster Bay, which is only partially
separated from Morecambe Bay by the promontory of Red
Nab. Morecambe Bay also detaches from the rest of the county
the district of Furness (<i>q.v.</i>), extending westward to the Duddon,
and having off its coast the island of Walney, 8 m. in length,
and several small isles within the strait between Walney and the
mainland. The principal seaside resorts and watering-places,
from S. to N., are Southport, Lytham, St Anne&rsquo;s-on-the-Sea,
Blackpool, Fleetwood and Morecambe; while at the head of
Morecambe Bay are several pleasant villages frequented by
visitors, such as Arnside and Grange. Of the rivers the Mersey
(<i>q.v.</i>), separating the county from Cheshire, is the principal,
and receives from Lancashire the Irwell, Sankey and other
small streams. The Ribble, which rises in the mountains of
the West Riding of Yorkshire, forms for a few miles the boundary
with that county, and then flows S.W. to Preston, receiving the
Hodder from the N. and the Calder and Darwen from the S.
Lancashire has a share in two of the English districts most
famous for their scenery, but does not include the finest part of
either. Furness, entirely hilly except for a narrow coastal
tract, extends N. to include the southern part of the Lake
District (<i>q.v.</i>); it contains Coniston Lake and borders Windermere,
which are drained respectively by the Leven and Crake,
with some smaller lakes and such mountains as the Old Man
and Wetherlam. Another elevated district, forming part of a
mountainous chain stretching from the Scottish border, covered
by the name of Pennine uplands in its broader application, runs
along the whole eastern boundary of the main portion of the
county, and to the south of the Ribble occupies more than half
the area, stretching west nearly to Liverpool. The moorlands
in the southern district are generally bleak and covered with
heather. Towards the north the scenery is frequently beautiful,
the green rounded elevated ridges being separated by pleasant
cultivated valleys variegated by woods and watered by rivers.
None of the summits of the range within Lancashire attains
an elevation of 2000 ft., the highest being Blackstone Edge
(<span class="correction" title="amended from 1323">1523</span> ft.), Pendle Hill (1831 ft.) and Boulsworth Hill (1700 ft.).</p>

<p>Along the sea-coast from the Mersey to Lancaster there is a
continuous plain formerly occupied by peat mosses, many of
which have been reclaimed. The largest is Chat Moss between
Liverpool and Manchester. In some instances these mosses
have exhibited the phenomenon of a moving bog. A large
district in the north belonging to the duchy of Lancaster was
at one time occupied by forests, but these have wholly disappeared,
though their existence is recalled in nomenclature,
as in the Forest of Rossendale, near the Yorkshire boundary
somewhat south of the centre.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;The greater part of Lancashire, the central and eastern
portions, is occupied by Carboniferous rocks; a broad belt of Triassic
strata fringes the west and south; while most of the detached
northern portion is made up of Silurian and Ordovician formations.
The Carboniferous system includes the great coal-field in which
are gathered all the principal manufacturing towns, Colne, Burnley,
Blackburn, Chorley, Wigan, Bolton, Preston, Oldham, Rochdale
and Manchester. In the centre of the coal-field is an elevated moorland
tract formed of the grits and shales of the Millstone Grit series.
Part of the small coal-field of Ingleton also lies within the county.
Between these two coal basins there is a moderately hilly district
in which grits and black shales predominate, with a broad tract of
limestone and shales which are well exposed in the quarries at
Clitheroe and at Longridge, Chipping, Whalley and Downham. The
limestone again appears in the north at Bolton-le-Sands, Burton-in-Kendall,
Grange, Ulverston and Dalton-in-Furness. Large pockets
of rich iron ore are worked in the limestone in the Furness district.
The belt of Trias includes the Bunter sandstone and conglomerate,
which ranges from Barrow-in-Furness, through Garstang, Preston,
Ormskirk, Liverpool, Warrington and Salford; and Keuper marls,
which underlie the surface between the Bunter outcrop and the sea.
On the coast there is a considerable development of blown sand
between Blackpool and Lytham and between Southport and Seaforth.
North of Broughton-in-Furness, Ulverston and Cartmel are
the Silurian rocks around Lakes Windermere and Coniston Water,
including the Coniston grits and flags and the Brathay flags. These
rocks are bounded by the Ordovician Coniston limestone, ranging
north-east and south-west, and the volcanic series of Borrowdale.
A good deal of the solid geology is obscured in many places by
glacial drift, boulder clay and sands.</p>

<p>The available coal supply of Lancashire has been estimated at
about five thousand millions of tons. In 1852 the amount raised was
8,225,000 tons; in 1899 it was 24,387,475 tons. In the production
of coal Lancashire vies with Yorkshire, but each is about one-third
below Durham. There are also raised in large quantities&mdash;fireclay,
limestone, sandstone, slate and salt, which is also obtained from
brine. The red hematitic iron obtained in the Furness district is
very valuable, but is liable to decrease. The district also produces
a fine blue slate. Metals, excepting iron, are unimportant.</p>

<p><i>Climate and Agriculture.</i>&mdash;The climate in the hilly districts is
frequently cold, but in the more sheltered parts lying to the south
and west it is mild and genial. From its westerly situation and the
attraction of the hills there is a high rainfall in the hilly districts
(<i>e.g.</i> at Bolton the average is 58.71 in.), while the average for the
other districts is about 35. The soil after reclamation and drainage
is fertile; but, as it is for the most part a strong clayey loam it
requires a large amount of labour. In some districts it is more of a
peaty nature, and in the Old Red Sandstone districts of the Mersey
there is a tract of light sandy loam, easily worked, and well adapted
for wheat and potatoes. In many districts the ground has been
rendered unfit for agricultural operations by the rubbish from
coal-pits. A low proportion (about seven-tenths) of the total area is
under cultivation, and of this nearly three-fourths is in permanent
pasture, cows being largely kept for the supply of milk to the towns,
while in the uplands many sheep are reared. In addition to the
cultivated area, about 92,000 acres are under hill pasturage. A
gradual increase is noticeable in the acreage under oats, which
occupy more than seven-tenths of the area under grain crops, and in
that under wheat, to the exclusion of the cultivation of barley. Of
green crops the potato is the chief.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Industries and Trade.</i>&mdash;South Lancashire is the principal
seat of the cotton manufacture in the world, the trade centring
upon Manchester, Oldham and the neighbouring densely populated
district. It employs upwards of 400,000 operatives.
The worsted, woollen and silk manufactures, flax, hemp and
jute industries, though of less importance, employ considerable
numbers. Non-textile factories employ about 385,000 hands.
The manufacture of machines, appliances, conveyances, tools,
&amp;c., are very important, especially in supplying the needs of
the immense weaving and spinning industries. For the same
purpose there is a large branch of industry in the manufacture
of bobbins from the wood grown in the northern districts of the
county. Of industries principally confined to certain definite
centres there may be mentioned&mdash;the manufacture of iron and
steel at Barrow-in-Furness, a town of remarkably rapid growth
since the middle of the 19th century; the great glass works
at St Helens; the watch-making works at Prescot and the
leather works at Warrington. Printing, bleaching and dyeing
works, paper and chemical works, india-rubber and tobacco
manufactures are among the chief of the other resources of this
great industrial region. Besides the port of Liverpool, of worldwide
importance, the principal ports are Manchester, brought
into communication with the sea by the Manchester Ship
Canal opened in 1894, Barrow-in-Furness and Fleetwood,
while Preston and Lancaster have docks and a considerable
shipping trade by the rivers Lune and Ribble respectively.
The sea fisheries, for which Fleetwood and Liverpool are the
chief ports, are of considerable value.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Communications.</i>&mdash;Apart from the Manchester Ship Canal, canal-traffic
plays an important part in the industrial region. In 1760 the
Sankey canal, 10 m. long, the first canal opened in Britain (apart
from very early works), was constructed to carry coal from St Helens
to Liverpool. Shortly afterwards the duke of Bridgewater projected
the great canal from Manchester across the Irwell to Worsley, completed
in 1761 and bearing the name of its originator. The Leeds
and Liverpool canal, begun in 1770, connects Liverpool and other
important towns with Leeds by a circuitous route of 130 m. The
other principal canals are the Rochdale, the Manchester (to Huddersfield)
and the Lancaster, connecting Preston and Kendal. A short
canal connects Ulverston with Morecambe Bay. A network of railways
covers the industrial region. The main line of the London and
North Western railway enters the county at Warrington, and runs
north through Wigan, Preston, Lancaster and Carnforth. It also
serves Liverpool and Manchester, providing the shortest route to
each of these cities from London, and shares with the Lancashire
and Yorkshire company joint lines to Southport, to Blackpool and
to Fleetwood, whence there is regular steamship communication with
Belfast. The Lancashire and Yorkshire line serves practically all
the important centres as far north as Preston and Fleetwood. All
the northern trunk lines from London have services to Manchester
and Liverpool. The Cheshire Lines system, worked by a committee
of the Great Northern, Great Central and Midland companies, links
their systems with the South Lancashire district generally, and
maintains lines between Liverpool and Manchester, both these cities
with Southport, and numerous branches. Branches of the Midland
railway from its main line in Yorkshire serve Lancaster, Morecambe,
and Heysham and Carnforth, where connexion is made with the
Furness railway to Ulverston, Barrow, Lake Side, Coniston, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Population and Administration.</i>&mdash;The area of the ancient
county is 1,203,365 acres. Its population in 1801 was 673,486;
in 1891, 3,926,760; and in 1901, 4,406,409. The area of the
administrative county is 1,196,753 acres. The distribution of
the industrial population may be best appreciated by showing
the parliamentary divisions, parliamentary, county and municipal
boroughs and urban districts as placed among the four
divisions of the ancient county. In the case of urban districts
the name of the great town to which each is near or adjacent

<p>Lancashire is one of the counties palatine. It is attached to
the duchy of Lancaster, a crown office, and retains the chancery
court for the county palatine. The chancery of the duchy
of Lancaster was once a court of appeal for the chancery of the
county palatine, but now even its jurisdiction in regard to
the estates of the duchy is merely nominal. The chancery of the
county palatine has concurrent jurisdiction with the High Court
of Chancery in all matters of equity within the county palatine,
and independent jurisdiction in regard to a variety of other
matters. The county palatine comprises six hundreds.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Lancashire is in the northern circuit, and assizes are held at
Lancaster for the north, and at Liverpool and Manchester for the
south of the county. There is one court of quarter sessions, and the
county is divided into 33 petty sessional divisions. The boroughs
of Blackburn, Bolton, Burnley, Liverpool, Manchester, Oldham,
Salford and Wigan have separate commissions of the peace and
courts of quarter sessions; and those of Accrington, Ashton-under-Lyne,
Barrow-in-Furness, Blackpool, Bolton, Bury, Clitheroe, Colne,
Darwen, Eccles, Heywood, Lancaster, Middleton, Mossley, Nelson,
Preston, Rochdale, St Helens, Southport and Warrington have
separate commissions of the peace only. There are 430 civil parishes.
Lancashire is mainly in the diocese of Manchester, but parts are in
those of Liverpool, Carlisle, Ripon, Chester and Wakefield. There
are 787 ecclesiastical parishes or districts wholly or in part within
the county.</p>

<p>Manchester and Liverpool are each seats of a university and of
other important educational institutions. Within the bounds of
the county there are many denominational colleges, and near
Clitheroe is the famous Roman Catholic college of Stonyhurst.
There is a day training college for schoolmasters in connexion with
University College, Liverpool, and a day training college for both
schoolmasters and schoolmistresses in connexion with Owens College,
Manchester. At Edgehill, Liverpool, there is a residential training
college for schoolmistresses which takes day pupils, at Liverpool a
residential Roman Catholic training college for schoolmasters, and
at Warrington a residential training college (Chester, Manchester
and Liverpool diocesan) for schoolmistresses.</p>
</div>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The district afterwards known as Lancashire was
after the departure of the Romans for many years apparently
little better than a waste. It was not until the victory of Æthelfrith,
king of Deira, near Chester in 613 cut off the Britons
of Wales from those of Lancashire and Cumberland that even
Lancashire south of the Ribble was conquered. The part north
of the Ribble was not absorbed in the Northumbrian kingdom
till the reign of Ecgfrith (670-685). Of the details of this long
struggle we know nothing, but to the stubborn resistance
made by the British leaders are due the legends of Arthur;
and of the twelve great battles he is supposed to have fought
against the English, four are traditionally, though probably
erroneously, said to have taken place on the river Douglas
near Wigan. In the long struggle for supremacy between
Mercia and Northumbria, the country between the Mersey and
Ribble was sometimes under one, sometimes under the other
kingdom. During the 9th century Lancashire was constantly
invaded by the Danes, and after the peace of Wedmore (878)
it was included in the Danish kingdom of Northumbria. The
<i>A.S. Chronicle</i> records the reconquest of the district between
the Ribble and Mersey in 923 by the English king, when it appears
to have been severed from the kingdom of Northumbria and
united to Mercia, but the districts north of the Ribble now
comprised in the county belonged to Northumbria until its
incorporation with the kingdom of England. The names on
the Lancashire coast ending in <i>by</i>, such as Crosby, Formby,
Roby, Kirkby, Derby, show where the Danish settlements were
thickest. William the Conqueror gave the lands between the
Ribble and Mersey, and Amounderness to Roger de Poictou,
but at the time of Domesday Book these had passed out of his
hand and belonged to the king.</p>

<p>The name Lancashire does not appear in Domesday; the lands
between the Ribble and Mersey were included in Cheshire and
those north of the Ribble in Yorkshire. Roger de Poictou
soon regained his lands, and Rufus added to his possessions
the rest of Lonsdale south of the Sands, of which he already
held a part; and as he had the Furness fells as well, he owned
all that is now known as Lancashire. In 1102 he finally forfeited
all his lands, which Henry I. held till, in 1118, he created the
honour of Lancaster by incorporating with Roger&rsquo;s forfeited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>141</span>
lands certain escheated manors in the counties of Nottingham,
Derby and Lincoln, and certain royal manors, and bestowed
it upon his nephew Stephen, afterwards king. During Stephen&rsquo;s
reign the history of the honour presents certain difficulties,
for David of Scotland held the lands north of the Ribble for a
time, and in 1147 the earl of Chester held the district between
the Ribble and Mersey. Henry II. gave the whole honour to
William, Stephen&rsquo;s son, but in 1164 it came again into the king&rsquo;s
hands until 1189, when Richard I. granted it to his brother
John. In 1194, owing to John&rsquo;s rebellion, it was confiscated
and the honour remained with the crown till 1267. In 1229,
however, all the crown demesne between the Ribble and Mersey
was granted to Ranulf, earl of Chester, and on his death in 1232
came to William Ferrers, earl of Derby, in right of his wife
Agnes, sister and co-heir of Ranulf. The Ferrers held it till
1266, when it was confiscated owing to the earl&rsquo;s rebellion.
In 1267 Henry III. granted the honour and county and all the
royal demesne therein to his son Edmund, who was created
earl of Lancaster. His son, Earl Thomas, married the heiress
of Henry de Lacy, earl of Lincoln, and thus obtained the great
estates belonging to the de Lacys in Lancashire. On the death
of Henry, the first duke of Lancaster, in 1361, the estates,
title and honour fell to John of Gaunt in right of his wife Blanche,
the duke&rsquo;s elder daughter, and by the accession of Henry IV.,
John of Gaunt&rsquo;s only son, to the throne, the duchy and honour
became merged in the crown.</p>

<p>The county of Lancaster is first mentioned in 1169 as contributing
100 marks to the Royal Exchequer for defaults and fines.
The creation of the honour decided the boundaries, throwing
into it Furness and Cartmel, which geographically belong to
Westmorland; Lonsdale and Amounderness, which in Domesday
had been surveyed under Yorkshire; and the land between the
Ribble and Mersey. In Domesday this district south of the
Ribble was divided into the six hundreds of West Derby,
Newton, Warrington, Blackburn, Salford and Leyland, but before
Henry II.&rsquo;s reign the hundreds of Warrington and Newton
were absorbed in that of West Derby. Neither Amounderness
nor Lonsdale was called a hundred in Domesday, but soon after
that time the former was treated as a hundred. Ecclesiastically
the whole of the county originally belonged to the diocese of
York, but after the reconquest of the district between the Ribble
and Mersey in 923 this part was placed under the bishop of Lichfield
in the archdeaconry of Chester, which was subdivided
into the rural deaneries of Manchester, Warrington and Leyland.
Up to 1541 the district north of the Ribble belonged to the
archdeaconry of Richmond in the diocese of York, and was
subdivided into the rural deaneries of Amounderness, Lonsdale
and Coupland. In 1541 the diocese of Chester was created,
including all Lancashire, which was divided into two archdeaconries:
Chester, comprising the rural deaneries of Manchester,
Warrington and Blackburn, and Richmond, comprising
the deaneries of Amounderness, Furness, Lonsdale and Kendal.
In 1847 the diocese of Manchester was created, which included
all Lancashire except parts of West Derby, which still belonged
to the diocese of Chester, and Furness and Cartmel, which were
added to Carlisle in 1856. In 1878 by the creation of the diocese
of Liverpool the south-eastern part of the county was subtracted
from the Manchester diocese.</p>

<p>No shire court was ever held for the county, but as a duchy
and county palatine it has its own special courts. It may have
enjoyed palatine jurisdiction under Earl Morcar before the
Conquest, but these privileges, if ever exercised, remained in
abeyance till 1351, when Henry, duke of Lancaster, received
power to have a chancery in the county of Lancaster and to issue
writs therefrom under his own seal, as well touching pleas of
the crown as any other relating to the common laws, and to
have all <i>Jura Regalia</i> belonging to a county palatine. In 1377
the county was erected into a palatinate for John of Gaunt&rsquo;s
life, and in 1390 these rights of jurisdiction were extended and
settled in perpetuity on the dukes of Lancaster. The county
palatine courts consist of a chancery which dates back at least
to 1376, a court of common pleas, the jurisdiction of which was
transferred in 1873 by the Judicature Act to the high court of
justice, and a court of criminal jurisdiction which in no way
differs from the king&rsquo;s ordinary court. In 1407 the duchy court
of Lancaster was created, in which all questions of revenue and
dignities affecting the duchy possessions are settled. The
chancery of the duchy has been for years practically obsolete.
The duchy and county palatine each has its own seal. The
office of chancellor of the duchy and county palatine dates
back to 1351.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Lancashire is famed for the number of old and important county
families living within its borders. The most intimately connected
with the history of the county are the Stanleys, whose chief seat is
Knowsley Hall. Sir John Stanley early in the 15th century married
the heiress of Lathom and thus obtained possession of Lathom and
Knowsley. In 1456 the head of the family was created a peer by
the title of Baron Stanley and in 1485 raised to the earldom of Derby.
The Molyneuxes of Sephton and Croxteth are probably descended
from William de Molines, who came to England with William the
Conqueror, and is on the roll of Battle Abbey. Roger de Poictou
gave him the manor of Sephton, and Richard de Molyneux who held
the estate under Henry II. is undoubtedly an ancestor of the family.
In 1628 Sir Richard Molyneux was advanced to the peerage of Ireland
by the title of Viscount Maryborough, and in 1771 Charles, Lord
Maryborough, became earl of Sefton in the peerage of Ireland. His
son was created a peer of the United Kingdom as Baron Sefton of
Croxteth. The Bootle Wilbrahams, earls of Lathom, are, it is said,
descended from John Botyll of Melling, who was alive in 1421, and
from the Wilbrahams of Cheshire, who date back at least to
Henry III.&rsquo;s reign. In 1755 the two families intermarried. In 1828
the title of Baron Skelmersdale was bestowed on the head of the
family and in 1880 that of earl of Lathorn. The Gerards of Bryn
are said to be descended from an old Tuscan family, one of whom
came to England in Edward the Confessor&rsquo;s time, and whose son is
mentioned in Domesday. Bryn came into this family by marriage
early in the 14th century. Sir Thomas Gerard was created a baronet
by James I. in 1611, and in 1876 a peerage was conferred on Sir Robert
Gerard. The Gerards of Ince were a collateral branch. The Lindsays,
earls of Crawford and Balcarres, are representative on the female side
of the Bradshaighs of Haigh Hall, who are said to be of Saxon origin.
Other great Lancashire families are the Hoghtons of Hoghton Tower,
dating back to the 12th century, the Blundells of Ince Blundell, who
are said to have held the manor since the 12th century, now represented
by the Weld-Blundells, the Tyldesleys of Tyldesley, now
extinct, and the Butlers of Bewsey, barons of Warrington, of whom
the last male heir died in 1586.</p>
</div>

<p>At the close of the 12th and during the 13th century there
was a considerable advance in the importance of the towns;
in 1199 Lancaster became a borough, in 1207 Liverpool, in 1230
Salford, in 1246 Wigan, and in 1301 Manchester. The Scottish
wars were a great drain to the county, not only because the north
part was subject to frequent invasions, as in 1322, but because
some of the best blood was taken for these wars. In 1297
Lancashire raised 1000 men, and at the battle of Falkirk (1298)
1000 Lancashire soldiers were in the vanguard, led by Henry
de Lacy, earl of Lincoln. In 1349 the county was visited by
the Black Death and a record exists of its ravages in Amounderness.
In ten parishes between September 1349 and January
1350, 13,180 persons perished. At Preston 3000 died, at Lancaster
3000, at Garstang 2000 and at Kirkham 3000. From the effects
of this plague Lancashire was apparently slow to recover; its
boroughs ceased to return members early in the 14th century
and trade had not yet made any great advance. The drain of
the Wars of the Roses on the county must also have been heavy,
although none of the battles was fought within its borders;
Lord Stanley&rsquo;s force of 5000 raised in Lancashire and Cheshire
virtually decided the battle of Bosworth Field. The poverty
of the county is shown by the fact that out of £40,000 granted
in 1504 by parliament to the king, Lancashire&rsquo;s share was only
£318. At the battle of Flodden (1513) the Lancashire archers
led by Sir Edward Stanley almost totally destroyed the Highlanders
on the right Scottish wing and greatly contributed to
the victory. Under the Tudors the county prospered; the
parliamentary boroughs once more began to return members,
the towns increased in size, many halls were built by the gentry
and trade increased.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In 1617 James I. visited Lancashire, and in consequence of a

imposed upon Sunday amusements, he issued in 1618 the famous
<i>Book of Sports</i>. Another of James&rsquo;s works, the <i>Daemonologie</i>, is

closely connected with the gross superstitions concerning witches
which were specially prevalent in Lancashire. The great centre
of this witchcraft was Pendle Forest, in the parish of Whalley, and
in 1612 twelve persons from Pendle and eight from Samlesbury were
tried for witchcraft, nine of whom were hanged. In 1633 another
batch of seventeen witches from Pendle were tried and all sentenced
to be executed, but the king pardoned them. This was the last
important case of witchcraft in Lancashire.</p>

<p>In the assessment of ship money in 1636 the county was put
down for £1000, towards which Wigan was to raise £50, Preston
£40, Lancaster £30, and Liverpool £25, and these figures compared
with the assessments of £140 on Hull and £200 on Leeds
show the comparative unimportance of the Lancashire boroughs.
On the eve of the Great Rebellion in 1641 parliament resolved
to take command of the militia, and Lord Strange, Lord Derby&rsquo;s
eldest son, was removed from the lord lieutenancy. On the
whole, the county was Royalist, and the moving spirit among
the Royalists was Lord Strange, who became Lord Derby in
1642. Manchester was the headquarters of the Parliamentarians,
and was besieged by Lord Derby in September 1642 for seven
days, but not taken. Lord Derby himself took up his headquarters
at Warrington and garrisoned Wigan. At the opening
of 1643 Sir Thomas Fairfax made Manchester his headquarters.
Early in February the Parliamentarians from Manchester
successfully assaulted Preston, which was strongly Royalist;
thence the Parliamentarians marched to Hoghton Tower, which
they took, and within a few days captured Lancaster. On the
Royalist side Lord Derby made an unsuccessful attack on
Bolton from Wigan. In March a large Spanish ship, laden with
ammunition for the use of parliament, was driven by a storm
on Rossall Point and seized by the Royalists; Lord Derby
ordered the ship to be burned, but the parliament forces from
Preston succeeded in carrying off some of the guns to Lancaster
castle. In March Lord Derby captured the town of Lancaster
but not the castle, and marching to Preston regained it for the
king, but was repulsed in an attack on Bolton. In April Wigan,
one of the chief Royalist strongholds in the county, was taken
by the parliament forces, who also again captured Lancaster,
and the guns from the Spanish ship were moved for use against
Warrington, which was obliged to surrender in May after a
week&rsquo;s siege. Lord Derby also failed in an attempt on Liverpool,
and the tide of war had clearly turned against the Royalists in
Lancashire. In June Lord Derby went to the Isle of Man,
which was threatened by the king&rsquo;s enemies. Soon after, the
Parliamentarians captured Hornby castle, and only two strongholds,
Thurland castle and Lathom house, remained in Royalist
hands. In the summer, after a seven weeks&rsquo; siege by Colonel
Alexander Rigby, Thurland castle surrendered and was demolished.
In February 1644 the Parliamentarians, under Colonel
Rigby, Colonel Ashton and Colonel Moore, besieged Lathom
house, the one refuge left to the Royalists, which was bravely
defended by Lord Derby&rsquo;s heroic wife, Charlotte de la Trémoille.
The siege lasted nearly four months and was raised on the
approach of Prince Rupert, who marched to Bolton and was
joined on his arrival outside the town by Lord Derby. Bolton
was carried by storm; Rupert ordered that no quarter should
be given, and it is usually said at least 1500 of the garrison were
slain. Prince Rupert advanced without delay to Liverpool,
which was defended by Colonel Moore, and took it after a siege
of three weeks. After the battle of Marston Moor Prince Rupert
again appeared in Lancashire and small engagements took place
at Ormskirk, Upholland and Preston; in November Liverpool
surrendered to the Parliamentarians. Lathom house was again
the only strong place in Lancashire left to the Royalists, and
in December 1645 after a five months&rsquo; siege it was compelled
to surrender through lack of provisions, and was almost entirely
destroyed. For the moment the war in Lancashire was over.
In 1648, however, the Royalist forces under the duke of Hamilton
and Sir Marmaduke Langdale marched through Lancaster to
Preston, hoping to reach Manchester; but near Preston were
defeated by Cromwell in person. The remnant retreated through
Wigan towards Warrington, and after being again defeated at
Winwick surrendered at Warrington. In 1651 Charles II.
advanced through Lancaster, Preston and Chorley on his southward
march, and Lord Derby after gathering forces was on his
way to meet him when he was defeated at Wigan. In 1658, after
Cromwell&rsquo;s death, a Royalist rebellion was raised in which
Lancashire took a prominent part, but it was quickly
suppressed. During the Rebellion of 1715 Manchester was the
chief centre of Roman Catholic and High Church Toryism.
On the 7th of November the Scottish army entered Lancaster,
where the Pretender was proclaimed king, and advanced to
Preston, at which place a considerable body of Roman Catholics
joined it. The rebels remained at Preston a few days, apparently
unaware of the advance of the government troops, until General
Wills from Manchester and General Carpenter from Lancaster
surrounded the town, and on the 13th of November the town
and the rebel garrison surrendered. Several of the rebels were
hanged at Preston, Wigan, Lancaster and other places. In
1745 Prince Charles Edward passed through the county and
was joined by about 200 adherents, called the Manchester
regiment and placed under the command of Colonel Townley,
who was afterwards executed.</p>

<p>The first industry established in Lancashire was that of
wool, and with the founding of Furness abbey in 1127 wool
farming on a large scale began here, but the bulk of the wool
grown was exported, not worked up in England. In 1282,
however, there was a mill for fulling or bleaching wool in Manchester,
and by the middle of the 16th century there was quite
a flourishing trade in worsted goods. In an act of 1552
Manchester &ldquo;rugs and frizes&rdquo; are specially mentioned, and in
1566 another act regulated the fees of the aulnager who was to
have his deputies at Manchester, Rochdale, Bolton, Blackburn
and Bury; the duty of the aulnagers was to prevent &ldquo;cottons,
frizes and rugs&rdquo; from being sold unsealed, but it must be noted
that by cottons is not meant what we now understand by the
word, but woollen goods. The 17th century saw the birth of the
class of clothiers, who purchased the wool in large quantities
or kept their own sheep, and delivered it to weavers who worked
it up into cloth in their houses and returned it to the employers.
The earliest mention of the manufacture of real cotton goods
is in 1641, when Manchester made fustians, vermilions and
dimities, but the industry did not develop to any extent until
after the invention of the fly shuttle by John Kay in 1733, of
the spinning jenny by James Hargreaves of Blackburn in 1765,
of the water frame throstle by Richard Arkwright of Bolton in
1769, and of the mule by Samuel Crompton of Hall-in-the-Wood
near Bolton in 1779. So rapid was the development of the
cotton manufacture that in 1787 there were over forty cotton
mills in Lancashire, all worked by water power. In 1789,
however, steam was applied to the industry in Manchester,
and in 1790 in Bolton a cotton mill was worked by steam. The
increase in the import of raw cotton from 3,870,000 &#8468; in 1769
to 1,083,600,000 in 1860 shows the growth of the industry.
The rapid growth was accompanied with intermittent periods
of depression, which in 1819 in particular led to the formation
of various political societies and to the Blanketeers&rsquo; Meeting
and the Peterloo Massacre. During the American Civil War
the five years&rsquo; cotton famine caused untold misery in the county,
but public and private relief mitigated the evils, and one good
result was the introduction of machinery capable of dealing with
the shorter staple of Indian cotton, thus rendering the trade
less dependent for its supplies on America.</p>

<p>During the 18th century the only town where maritime trade
increased was Liverpool, where in the last decade about 4500
ships arrived annually of a tonnage about one-fifth that of the
London shipping. The prosperity of Liverpool was closely
bound up with the slave trade, and about one-fourth of its
ships were employed in this business. With the increase of
trade the means of communication improved. In 1758 the duke
of Bridgewater began the Bridgewater canal from Worsley to
Salford and across the Irwell to Manchester, and before the end
of the century the county was intersected by canals. In 1830
the first railway in England was opened between Manchester
and Liverpool, and other railways rapidly followed.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The first recorded instance of parliamentary representation in
Lancashire was in 1295, when two knights were returned for the
county and two burgesses each for the boroughs of Lancaster,
Preston, Wigan and Liverpool. The sheriff added to this return
&ldquo;There is no city in the county of Lancaster.&rdquo; The boroughs were,
however, excused one after another from parliamentary representation,
which was felt as a burden owing to the compulsory
payment of the members&rsquo; wages. Lancaster ceased to send members
in 1331 after making nineteen returns, but renewed its privileges in
1529; from 1529 to 1547 there are no parliamentary returns, but
from 1547 to 1867 Lancaster continued to return two members.
Preston similarly was excused after 1331, after making eleven
returns, but in 1529 and from 1547 onwards returned two members.
Liverpool and Wigan sent members in 1295 and 1307, but not again
till 1547. To the writ issued in 1362 the sheriff in his return says:
&ldquo;There is not any City or Borough in this County from which
citizens or burgesses ought or are accustomed to come as this Writ
requires.&rdquo; In 1559 Clitheroe and Newton-le-Willows first sent
two members. Thus in all Lancashire returned fourteen members,
and, with a brief exception during the Commonwealth, this continued
to be the parliamentary representation till 1832. By the Reform Act
of 1832 Lancashire was assigned four members, two for the northern
and two for the southern division. Lancaster, Preston, Wigan
and Liverpool continued to send two members, Clitheroe returned
one and Newton was disfranchised. The following new boroughs
were created: Manchester, Bolton, Blackburn, Oldham, returning
two members each; Ashton-under-Lyne, Bury, Rochdale, Salford
and Warrington, one each. In 1861 a third member was given to
South Lancashire and in 1867 the county was divided into four constituencies,
to each of which four members were assigned; since 1885
the county returns twenty-three members. The boroughs returned
from 1867 to 1885 twenty-five members, and since 1885 thirty-four.</p>

<p><i>Antiquities.</i>&mdash;The Cistercian abbey of Furness (<i>q.v.</i>) is one of the
finest and most extensive ecclesiastical ruins in England. Whalley
abbey, first founded at Stanlawe in Cheshire in 1178, and removed
in 1296, belonged to the same order. There was a priory of Black
Canons at Burscough, founded in the time of Richard I., one at
Conishead dating from Henry II.&rsquo;s reign, and one at Lancaster.
A convent of Augustinian friars was founded at Cartmel in 1188,
and one at Warrington about 1280. There are some remains of the
Benedictine priory of Upholland, changed from a college of secular
priests in 1318; and the same order had a priory at Lancaster
founded in 1094, a cell at Lytham, of the reign of Richard I., and a
priory at Penwortham, founded shortly after the time of the Conqueror.
The Premonstratensians had Cockersand abbey, changed
in 1190 from a hospital founded in the reign of Henry II., of which
the chapter-house remains. At Kersal, near Manchester, there was
a cell of Cluniac monks founded in the reign of John, while at Lancaster
there were convents of Dominicans and Franciscans, and at
Preston a priory of Grey Friars built by Edmund, earl of Lancaster,
son of Henry III.</p>

<p>Besides the churches mentioned under the several towns, the
more interesting are those of Aldingham, Norman doorway;
Aughton; Cartmel priory church (see Furness); Hawkshead;
Heysham, Norman with traces of earlier date; Hoole; Huyton;
Kirkby, rebuilt, with very ancient font; Kirkby Ireleth, late
Perpendicular, with Norman doorway; Leyland; Melling (in
Lonsdale), Perpendicular, with stained-glass windows; Middleton,
rebuilt in 1524, but containing part of the Norman church and
several monuments; Ormskirk, Perpendicular with traces of
Norman, having two towers, one of which is detached and surmounted
by a spire; Overton, with Norman doorway; Radcliffe, Norman;
Sefton, Perpendicular, with fine brass and recumbent figures of the
Molyneux family, also a screen exquisitely carved; Stidd, near
Ribchester, Norman arch and old monuments; Tunstall, late
Perpendicular; Upholland priory church, Early English, with low
massy tower; Urswick, Norman, with embattled tower and several
old monuments; Walton-on-the-hill, anciently the parish church
of Liverpool; Walton-le-Dale; Warton, with old font; Whalley
abbey church, Decorated and Perpendicular, with Runic stone
monuments.</p>

<p>The principal old castles are those of Lancaster; Dalton, a small
rude tower occupying the site of an older building; two towers of
Gleaston castle, built by the lords of Aldingham in the 14th century;
the ruins of Greenhalgh castle, built by the first earl of Derby, and
demolished after a siege by order of parliament in 1649; the ruins of
Fouldrey in Piel Island near the entrance to Barrow harbour,
erected in the reign of Edward III., now most dilapidated. There
are many old timber houses and mansions of interest, as well as
numerous modern seats.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANCASTER, HOUSE OF.<a name="ar26" id="ar26"></a></span> The name House of Lancaster is
commonly used to designate the line of English kings immediately
descended from John of Gaunt, the fourth son of Edward III.
But the history of the family and of the title goes back to
the reign of Henry III., who created his second son, Edmund,
earl of Lancaster in 1267. This Edmund received in his own
day the surname of Crouchback, not, as was afterwards supposed,
from a personal deformity, but from having worn a cross upon
his back in token of a crusading vow. He is not a person of
much importance in history except in relation to a strange
theory raised in a later age about his birth, which we shall notice
presently. His son Thomas, who inherited the title, took the
lead among the nobles of Edward II.&rsquo;s time in opposition to
Piers Gaveston and the Despensers, and was beheaded for treason
at Pontefract. At the commencement of the following reign
his attainder was reversed and his brother Henry restored to
the earldom; and Henry being appointed guardian to the young
king Edward III., assisted him to throw off the yoke of Mortimer.
On this Henry&rsquo;s death in 1345 he was succeeded by a son of the
same name, sometimes known as Henry Tort-Col or Wryneck, a
very valiant commander in the French wars, whom the king
advanced to the dignity of a duke. Only one duke had been
created in England before, and that was fourteen years previously,
when the king&rsquo;s son Edward, the Black Prince, was made duke
of Cornwall. This Henry Wryneck died in 1361 without heir
male. His second daughter, Blanche, became the wife of John
of Gaunt, who thus succeeded to the duke&rsquo;s inheritance in her
right; and on the 13th of November 1362, when King Edward
attained the age of fifty, John was created duke of Lancaster,
his elder brother, Lionel, being at the same time created duke of
Clarence. It was from these two dukes that the rival houses
of Lancaster and York derived their respective claims to the
crown. As Clarence was King Edward&rsquo;s third son, while John
of Gaunt was his fourth, in ordinary course on the failure of the
elder line the issue of Clarence should have taken precedence
of that of Lancaster in the succession. But the rights of Clarence
were conveyed in the first instance to an only daughter, and the
ambition and policy of the house of Lancaster, profiting by
advantageous circumstances, enabled them not only to gain
possession of the throne but to maintain themselves in it for
three generations before they were dispossessed by the representatives
of the elder brother.</p>

<p>As for John of Gaunt himself, it can hardly be said that this
sort of politic wisdom is very conspicuous in him. His ambition
was generally more manifest than his discretion; but fortune
favoured his ambition, even as to himself, somewhat beyond
expectation, and still more in his posterity. Before the death of
his father he had become the greatest subject in England, his
three elder brothers having all died before him. He had even
added to his other dignities the title of king of Castile, having
married, after his first wife&rsquo;s death, the daughter of Peter the
Cruel. The title, however, was an empty one, the throne of
Castile being actually in the possession of Henry of Trastamara,
whom the English had vainly endeavoured to set aside. His
military and naval enterprises were for the most part disastrous
failures, and in England he was exceedingly unpopular. Nevertheless,
during the later years of his father&rsquo;s reign the weakness
of the king and the declining health of the Black Prince threw
the government very much into his hands. He even aimed,
or was suspected of aiming, at the succession to the crown; but
in this hope he was disappointed by the action of the Good
Parliament a year before Edward&rsquo;s death, in which it was settled
that Richard the son of the Black Prince should be king after
his grandfather. Nevertheless the suspicion with which he was
regarded was not altogether quieted when Richard came to the
throne, a boy in the eleventh year of his age. The duke himself
complained in parliament of the way he was spoken of out of
doors, and at the outbreak of Wat Tyler&rsquo;s insurrection the
peasants stopped pilgrims on the road to Canterbury and made
them swear never to accept a king of the name of John. On
gaining possession of London they burnt his magnificent
palace of the Savoy. Richard found a convenient way to get
rid of John of Gaunt by sending him to Castile to make good his
barren title, and on this expedition he was away three years.
He succeeded so far as to make a treaty with his rival, King
John, son of Henry of Trastamara, for the succession, by virtue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>144</span>
of which his daughter Catherine became the wife of Henry III.
of Castile some years later. After his return the king seems to
have regarded him with greater favour, created him duke of
Aquitaine, and employed him in repeated embassies to France,
which at length resulted in a treaty of peace, and Richard&rsquo;s
marriage to the French king&rsquo;s daughter.</p>

<p>Another marked incident of his public life was the support
which he gave on one occasion to the Reformer Wycliffe. How
far this was due to religious and how far to political considerations
may be a question; but not only John of Gaunt but his immediate
descendants, the three kings of the house of Lancaster, all took
deep interest in the religious movements of the times. A reaction
against Lollardy, however, had already begun in the
days of Henry IV., and both he and his son felt obliged to discountenance
opinions which were believed to be politically and
theologically dangerous.</p>

<p>Accusations had been made against John of Gaunt more than
once during the earlier part of Richard II.&rsquo;s reign of entertaining
designs to supplant his nephew on the throne. But these Richard
never seems to have wholly credited, and during his three years&rsquo;
absence his younger brother, Thomas of Woodstock, duke of
Gloucester, showed himself a far more dangerous intriguer.
Five confederate lords with Gloucester at their head took up
arms against the king&rsquo;s favourite ministers, and the Wonderful
Parliament put to death without remorse almost every agent
of his former administration who had not fled the country.
Gloucester even contemplated the dethronement of the king,
but found that in this matter he could not rely on the support
of his associates, one of whom was Henry, earl of Derby, the
duke of Lancaster&rsquo;s son. Richard soon afterwards, by declaring
himself of age, shook off his uncle&rsquo;s control, and within ten years
the acts of the Wonderful Parliament were reversed by a parliament
no less arbitrary. Gloucester and his allies were then
brought to account; but the earl of Derby and Thomas Mowbray,
earl of Nottingham, were taken into favour as having opposed
the more violent proceedings of their associates. As if to show
his entire confidence in both these noblemen, the king created
the former duke of Hereford and the latter duke of Norfolk.
But within three months from this time the one duke accused
the other of treason, and the truth of the charge, after much
consideration, was referred to trial by battle according to the
laws of chivalry. But when the combat was about to commence
it was interrupted by the king, who, to preserve the peace of
the kingdom, decreed by his own mere authority that the duke
of Hereford should be banished for ten years&mdash;a term immediately
afterwards reduced to five&mdash;and the duke of Norfolk for life.</p>

<p>This arbitrary sentence was obeyed in the first instance by
both parties, and Norfolk never returned. But Henry, duke
of Hereford, whose milder sentence was doubtless owing to the
fact that he was the popular favourite, came back within a year,
having been furnished with a very fair pretext for doing so by
a new act of injustice on the part of Richard. His father, John
of Gaunt, had died in the interval, and the king, troubled with
a rebellion in Ireland, and sorely in want of money, had seized
the duchy of Lancaster as forfeited property. Henry at once
sailed for England, and landing in Yorkshire while King Richard
was in Ireland, gave out that he came only to recover his inheritance.
He at once received the support of the northern
lords, and as he marched southwards the whole kingdom was
soon practically at his command. Richard, by the time he had
recrossed the channel to Wales, discovered that his cause was
lost. He was conveyed from Chester to London, and forced to
execute a deed by which he resigned his crown. This was recited
in parliament, and he was formally deposed. The duke of
Lancaster then claimed the kingdom as due to himself by virtue
of his descent from Henry III.</p>

<p>The claim which he put forward involved, to all appearance,
a strange falsification of history, for it seemed to rest upon the
supposition that Edmund of Lancaster, and not Edward I.,
was the eldest son of Henry III. A story had gone about,
even in the days of John of Gaunt, who, if we may trust the
rhymer John Hardyng (<i>Chronicle</i>, pp. 290, 291), had got it
inserted in chronicles deposited in various monasteries, that this
Edmund, surnamed Crouchback, was really hump-backed, and
that he was set aside in favour of his younger brother Edward
on account of his deformity. No chronicle, however, is known
to exist which actually states that Edmund Crouchback was
thus set aside; and in point of fact he had no deformity at all,
while Edward was six years his senior. Hardyng&rsquo;s testimony is,
moreover, suspicious as reflecting the prejudices of the Percys
after they had turned against Henry IV., for Hardyng himself
expressly says that the earl of Northumberland was the source
of his information (see note, p. 353 of his <i>Chronicle</i>). But a
statement in the continuation of the chronicle called the <i>Eulogium</i>
(vol. iii. pp. 369, 370) corroborates Hardyng to some extent;
for we are told that John of Gaunt had once desired in parliament
that his son should be recognized on this flimsy plea as
heir to the crown; and when Roger Mortimer, earl of March,
denied the story and insisted on his own claim as descended from
Lionel, duke of Clarence, Richard imposed silence on both parties.
However this may be, it is certain that this story, though not
directly asserted to be true, was indirectly pointed at by Henry
when he put forward his claim, and no one was then bold enough
to challenge it.</p>

<p>This was partly due, no doubt, to the fact that the true
lineal heir after Richard was then a child, Edmund, who had just
succeeded his father as earl of March. Another circumstance
was unfavourable to the house of Mortimer&mdash;that it derived its
title through a woman. No case precisely similar had as yet
arisen, and, notwithstanding the precedent of Henry II., it
might be doubted whether succession through a female was
favoured by the constitution. If not, Henry could say with
truth that he was the direct heir of his grandfather, Edward III.
If, on the other hand, succession through females was valid,
he could trace his descent through his mother from Henry III.
by a very illustrious line of ancestors. And, in the words by
which he formally made his claim, he ventured to say no more
than that he was descended from the king last mentioned &ldquo;by
right line of the blood.&rdquo; In what particular way that &ldquo;right
line&rdquo; was to be traced he did not venture to indicate.</p>

<p>A brief epitome of the reigns of the three successive kings
belonging to the house of Lancaster (Henry IV., V. and VI.)
will be found elsewhere. With the death of Henry VI. the
direct male line of John of Gaunt became extinct. But by his
daughters he became the ancestor of more than one line of foreign
kings, while his descendants by his third wife, Catherine Swynford,
conveyed the crown of England to the house of Tudor. It is
true that his children by this lady were born before he married
her; but they were made legitimate by act of parliament, and,
though Henry IV. in confirming the privilege thus granted to
them endeavoured to debar them from the succession to the
crown, it is now ascertained that there was no such reservation
in the original act, and the title claimed by Henry VII. was
probably better than he himself supposed.</p>

<p>We show on the following page a pedigree of the royal and
illustrious houses that traced their descent from John of
Gaunt.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANCASTER, HENRY,<a name="ar27" id="ar27"></a></span> <span class="sc">Earl of</span> (<i>c.</i> 1281-1345), was the
second son of Edmund, earl of Lancaster (d. 1296), and consequently
a grandson of Henry III. During his early days he
took part in campaigns in Flanders, Scotland and Wales, but
was quite overshadowed by his elder brother Thomas (see
below). In 1324, two years after Thomas had lost his life for
opposing the king, Henry was made earl of Leicester by his
cousin, Edward II., but he was not able to secure the titles and
estates of Lancaster to which he was heir, and be showed openly
that his sympathies were with his dead brother. When Queen
Isabella took up arms against her husband in 1326 she was
joined at once by the earl, who took a leading part in the proceedings
against the king and his favourites, the Despensers,
being Edward&rsquo;s gaoler at Kenilworth castle. Edward III.
being now on the throne, Leicester secured the earldom of
Lancaster and his brother&rsquo;s lands, becoming also steward of
England; he knighted the young king and was the foremost
member of the royal council, but he was soon at variance with
Isabella and her paramour, Roger Mortimer, and was practically
deprived of his power. In 1328 his attempt to overthrow
Mortimer failed, and he quietly made his peace with the king;
a second essay against Mortimer was more successful. About
this time Lancaster became blind; he retired from public life
and died on the 22nd of September, 1345.

<p>His son and successor, <span class="sc">Henry</span>, 1st duke of Lancaster
(<i>c.</i> 1300-1361), was a soldier of unusual distinction. Probably
from his birthplace in Monmouthshire he was called Henry of
Grosmont. He fought in the naval fight off Sluys and in the one
off Winchelsea in 1350; he led armies into Scotland, Gascony
and Normandy, his exploits in Gascony in 1345 and 1346 being
especially successful; he served frequently under Edward III.
himself; and he may be fairly described as one of the most
brilliant and capable of the English warriors during the earlier
part of the Hundred Years&rsquo; War. During a brief respite from
the king&rsquo;s service he led a force into Prussia and he was often
employed on diplomatic business. In 1354 he was at Avignon
negotiating with Pope Innocent VI., who wished to make peace
between England and France, and one of his last acts was to
assist in arranging the details of the treaty of Brétigny in 1360.
In 1337 he was made earl of Derby; in 1345 he succeeded to
his father&rsquo;s earldoms of Lancaster and Leicester; in 1349 he
was created earl of Lincoln, and in 1351 he was made duke of
Lancaster. He was steward of England and one of the original
knights of the order of the garter. He died at Leicester on the
13th of March 1361. He left no sons; one of his daughters,
Maud (d. 1362), married William V., count of Holland, a son
of the emperor Louis the Bavarian, and the other, Blanche
(d. 1369), married Edward III.&rsquo;s son, John of Gaunt, who

<p><span class="bold">LANCASTER, SIR JAMES<a name="ar28" id="ar28"></a></span> (fl. 1591-1618), English navigator
and statesman, one of the foremost pioneers of the British Indian
trade and empire. In early life he fought and traded in Portugal.
On the 10th of April 1591 he started from Plymouth, with
Raymond and Foxcroft, on his first great voyage to the East
Indies; this fleet of three ships is the earliest of English oversea
Indian expeditions. Reaching Table Bay (1st of August 1591),
and losing one ship off Cape Corrientes on the 12th of September,
the squadron rested and refitted at Zanzibar (February 1592),
rounded Cape Comorin in May following, and was off the Malay
Peninsula in June. Crossing later to Ceylon, the crews insisted
on returning home; the voyage back was disastrous; only
twenty-five officers and men reappeared in England in 1594.
Lancaster himself reached Rye on the 24th of May 1594; in the
same year he led a military expedition against Pernambuco,
without much success; but his Indian voyage, like Ralph
Fitch&rsquo;s overland explorations and trading, was an important
factor in the foundation of the East India Company. In 1600
he was given command of the company&rsquo;s first fleet (which
sailed from Torbay towards the end of April 1601); he was
also accredited as Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s special envoy to various
Eastern potentates. Going by the Cape of Good Hope (1st of
November 1601) Lancaster visited the Nicobars (from the 9th
of April 1602), Achin and other parts of Sumatra (from the
5th of June 1602), and Bantam in Java; an alliance was concluded
with Achin, a factory established at Bantam and a
commercial mission despatched to the Moluccas. The return
voyage (20th of February to 11th of September 1603) was
speedy and prosperous, and Lancaster (whose success both in
trade and in diplomacy had been brilliant) was rewarded with
knighthood (October 1603). He continued to be one of the chief
directors of the East India Company till his death in May 1618;
most of the voyages of the early Stuart time both to India and
in search of the North-West passage were undertaken under his
advice and direction; Lancaster Sound, on the north-west of
Baffin&rsquo;s Bay (in 74° 20&prime; N.), was named by William Baffin after
Sir James (July 1616).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANCASTER, JOHN OF GAUNT,<a name="ar29" id="ar29"></a></span> <i>Duke of</i> (1340-1399),
fourth son of Edward III. and Queen Philippa, was born in
March 1340 at Ghent, whence his name. On the 29th of
September 1342 he was made earl of Richmond; as a child he
was present at the sea fight with the Spaniards in August 1350,
but his first military service was in 1355, when he was knighted.
On the 19th of May 1359 he married his cousin Blanche, daughter
and ultimately sole heiress of Henry, duke of Lancaster. In her
right he became earl of Lancaster in 1361, and next year was
created duke. His marriage made him the greatest lord in
England, but for some time he took no prominent part in public
affairs. In 1366 he joined his eldest brother, Edward the Black
Prince, in Aquitaine, and in the year after led a strong contingent
to share in the campaign in support of Pedro the Cruel of Castile.
With this began the connexion with Spain, which was to have
so great an influence on his after-life. John fought in the van at
Najera on the 3rd of April 1367, when the English victory restored
Pedro to his throne. He returned home at the end of the year.
Pedro proved false to his English allies, and was finally overthrown
and killed by his rival, Henry of Trastamara, in 1369.
The disastrous Spanish enterprise led directly to renewed war
between France and England. In August 1369 John had command
of an army which invaded northern France without
success. In the following year he went again to Aquitaine, and
was present with the Black Prince at the sack of Limoges.
Edward&rsquo;s health was broken down, and he soon after went home,
leaving John as his lieutenant. For a year John maintained the
war at his own cost, but whilst in Aquitaine a greater prospect
was opened to him. The duchess Blanche had died in the autumn
of 1369 and now John married Constance (d. 1394), the elder
daughter of Pedro the Cruel, and in her right assumed the title
of king of Castile and Leon. For sixteen years the pursuit of
his kingdom was the chief object of John&rsquo;s ambition. No
doubt he hoped to achieve his end, when he commanded the
great army which invaded France in 1373. But the French
would not give battle, and though John marched from Calais
right through Champagne, Burgundy and Auvergne, it was
with disastrous results; only a shattered remnant of the host
reached Bordeaux.</p>

<p>The Spanish scheme had to wait, and when John got back to
England he was soon absorbed in domestic politics. The king
was prematurely old, the Black Prince&rsquo;s health was broken.
John, in spite of the unpopularity of his ill-success, was forced
into the foremost place. As head of the court party he had to
bear the brunt of the attack on the administration made by
the Good Parliament in 1376. It was not perhaps altogether
just, and John was embittered by reflections on his loyalty.
As soon as the parliament was dissolved he had its proceedings
reversed, and next year secured a more subservient assembly.
There came, however, a new development. The duke&rsquo;s politics
were opposed by the chief ecclesiastics, and in resisting them
he had made use of Wycliffe. With Wycliffe&rsquo;s religious opinions
he had no sympathy. Nevertheless when the bishops arraigned
the reformer for heresy John would not abandon him. The conflict
over the trial led to a violent quarrel with the Londoners,
and a riot in the city during which John was in danger of his
life from the angry citizens. The situation was entirely altered
by the death of Edward III. on the 21st of June. Though his
enemies had accused him of aiming at the throne, John was
without any taint of disloyalty. In his nephew&rsquo;s interests he
accepted a compromise, disclaimed before parliament the truth
of the malicious rumours against him, and was reconciled formally
with his opponents. Though he took his proper place in the
ceremonies at Richard&rsquo;s coronation, he showed a tactful moderation
by withdrawing for a time from any share in the government.
However, in the summer of 1378, he commanded in an
attack on St Malo, which through no fault of his failed. To add
to this misfortune, during his absence some of his supporters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>147</span>
violated the sanctuary at Westminster. He vindicated himself
somewhat bitterly in a parliament at Gloucester, but still avoiding
a prominent part in the government, accepted the command on
the Scottish border. He was there engaged when his palace
of the Savoy in London was burnt during the peasants&rsquo; revolt
in June 1381. Wild reports that even the government had
declared him a traitor made him seek refuge in Scotland. Richard
had, however, denounced the calumnies, and at once recalled his
uncle.</p>

<p>John&rsquo;s self-restraint had strengthened his position, and he
began again to think of his Spanish scheme. He urged its
undertaking in parliament in 1382, but nearer troubles were
more urgent, and John himself was wanted on the Scottish
border. There he sought to arrange peace, but against his will
was forced into an unfortunate campaign in 1384. His ill-success
renewed his unpopularity, and the court favourites of Richard II.
intrigued against him. They were probably responsible for the
allegation, made by a Carmelite, called Latemar, that John was
conspiring against his nephew. Though Richard at first believed
it, the matter was disposed of by the friar&rsquo;s death. However,
the court party soon after concocted a fresh plot for the duke&rsquo;s
destruction; John boldly denounced his traducers, and the
quarrel was appeased by the intervention of the king&rsquo;s mother.
The intrigue still continued, and broke out again during the
Scottish campaign in 1385. John was not the man to be forced
into treason to his family, but the impossibility of the position
at home made his foreign ambitions more feasible.</p>

<p>The victory of John of Portugal over the king of Castile at
Aljubarrota, won with English help, offered an opportunity.
In July 1386 John left England with a strong force to win his
Spanish throne. He landed at Corunna, and during the autumn
conquered Galicia. Juan, who had succeeded his father Henry
as king of Castile, offered a compromise by marriage. John of
Gaunt refused, hoping for greater success with the help of the
king of Portugal, who now married the duke&rsquo;s eldest daughter
Philippa. In the spring the allies invaded Castile. They could
achieve no success, and sickness ruined the English army. The
conquests of the previous year were lost, and when Juan renewed
his offers, John of Gaunt agreed to surrender his claims to his
daughter by Constance of Castile, who was to marry Juan&rsquo;s heir.
After some delay the peace was concluded at Bayonne in 1388.
The next eighteen months were spent by John as lieutenant of
Aquitaine, and it was not till November 1389 that he returned
to England. By his absence he had avoided implication in the
troubles at home. Richard, still insecure of his own position,
welcomed his uncle, and early in the following year marked his
favour by creating him duke of Aquitaine. John on his part was
glad to support the king&rsquo;s government; during four years he
exercised his influence in favour of pacification at home, and
abroad was chiefly responsible for the conclusion of a truce with
France. Then in 1395 he went to take up the government of his
duchy; thanks chiefly to his lavish expenditure his administration
was not unsuccessful, but the Gascons had from the first
objected to government except by the crown, and secured his
recall within less than a year. Almost immediately after his
return John married as his third wife Catherine Swynford;
Constance of Castile had died in 1394. Catherine had been his
mistress for many years, and his children by her, who bore the
name of Beaufort, were now legitimated. In this and in other
matters Richard found it politic to conciliate him. But though
John presided at the trial of the earl of Arundel in September
1397, he took no active part in affairs. The exile of his son Henry
in 1398 was a blow from which he did not recover. He died on
the 3rd of February 1399, and was buried at St Paul&rsquo;s near the
high altar.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>John was neither a great soldier nor a statesman, but he was a
chivalrous knight and loyal to what he believed were the interests
of his family. In spite of opportunities and provocations he never
lent himself to treason. He deserves credit for his protection of
Wycliffe, though he had no sympathy with his religious or political
opinions. He was also the patron of Chaucer, whose <i>Boke of the
Duchesse</i> was a lament for Blanche of Lancaster.</p>

<p>The chief original sources for John&rsquo;s life are Froissart, the
maliciously hostile <i>Chronicon Angliae</i> (1328-1388), and the eulogistic
<i>Chronicle</i> of Henry Knighton (both the latter in the Rolls Series).

<p><span class="bold">LANCASTER, JOSEPH<a name="ar30" id="ar30"></a></span> (1778-1838), English educationist,
was born in Southwark in 1778, the son of a Chelsea pensioner.
He had few opportunities of regular instruction, but he very
early showed unusual seriousness and desire for learning. At
sixteen he looked forward to the dissenting ministry; but soon
after his religious views altered, and he attached himself to the
Society of Friends, with which he remained associated for many
years, until long afterwards he was disowned by that body.
At the age of twenty he began to gather a few poor children under
his father&rsquo;s roof, and to give them the rudiments of instruction,
without a fee, except in cases in which the parent was willing
to pay a trifle. Soon a thousand children were assembled in
the Borough Road; and, the attention of the duke of Bedford,
Mr Whitbread, and others having been directed to his efforts,
he was provided with means for building a schoolroom and
supplying needful materials. The main features of his plan
were the employment of older scholars as monitors, and an
elaborate system of mechanical drill, by means of which these
young teachers were made to impart the rudiments of reading,
writing and arithmetic to large numbers at the same time. The
material appliances for teaching were very scanty&mdash;a few leaves
torn out of spelling-books and pasted on boards, some slates and
a desk spread with sand, on which the children wrote with their
fingers. The order and cheerfulness of the school and the
military precision of the children&rsquo;s movements began to attract
much public observation at a time when the education of the
poor was almost entirely neglected. Lancaster inspired his
young monitors with fondness for their work and with pride
in the institution of which they formed a part. As these youths
became more trustworthy, he found himself at leisure to accept
invitations to expound what he called &ldquo;his system&rdquo; by lectures
in various towns. In this way many new schools were established,
and placed under the care of young men whom he had trained.
In a memorable interview with George III., Lancaster was
encouraged by the expression of the king&rsquo;s wish that every poor
child in his dominions should be taught to read the Bible.
Royal patronage brought in its train resources, fame and public
responsibility, which proved to be beyond Lancaster&rsquo;s own
powers to sustain or control. He was vain, reckless and improvident.
In 1808 a few noblemen and gentlemen paid his
debts, became his trustees and founded the society at first called
the Royal Lancasterian Institution, but afterwards more widely
known as the British and Foreign School Society. The trustees
soon found that Lancaster was impatient of control, and that
his wild impulses and heedless extravagance made it impossible
to work with him. He quarrelled with the committee, set up
a private school at Tooting, became bankrupt, and in 1818
emigrated to America. There he met at first a warm reception,
gave several courses of lectures which were well attended,
and wrote to friends at home letters full of enthusiasm. But his
fame was short-lived. The miseries of debt and disappointment
were aggravated by sickness, and he settled for a time in the
warmer climate of Carácas. He afterwards visited St Thomas
and Santa Cruz, and at length returned to New York, the
corporation of which city made him a public grant of 500 dollars
in pity for the misfortunes which had by this time reduced
him to lamentable poverty. He afterwards visited Canada,
where he gave lectures at Montreal, and was encouraged to open
a school which enjoyed an ephemeral success, but was soon
abandoned. A small annuity provided by his friends in England
was his only means of support. He formed a plan for returning
home and giving a new impetus to his &ldquo;system,&rdquo; by which he
declared it would be possible &ldquo;to teach ten thousand children
in different schools, not knowing their letters, all to read fluently
in three weeks to three months.&rdquo; But these visions were never
realized. He was run over by a carriage in the streets of New
York on the 24th of October 1838, and died in a few hours.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>As one of the two rival inventors of what was called the &ldquo;monitorial&rdquo;
or &ldquo;mutual&rdquo; method of instruction, Lancaster&rsquo;s name was
prominent for many years in educational controversy. Dr Andrew
Bell (<i>q.v.</i>) had in 1797 published an account of his experiments in
teaching; and Lancaster in his first pamphlet, published in 1803,
frankly acknowledges his debt to Bell for some useful hints. The
two worked independently, but Lancaster was the first to apply
the system of monitorial teaching on a large scale. As an economical
experiment his school at the Borough Road was a signal success.
He had one thousand scholars under discipline, and taught them to
read, write and work simple sums at a yearly cost of less than 5s. a
head. His tract <i>Improvements in Education</i> described the gradation
of ranks, the system of signals and orders, the functions of the
monitors, the method of counting and of spelling and the curious
devices he adopted for punishing offenders. Bell&rsquo;s educational aims
were humbler, as he feared to &ldquo;elevate above their station those
who were doomed to the drudgery of daily labour,&rdquo; and therefore
did not desire to teach even writing and ciphering to the lower
classes. The main difference between them was that the system
of the one was adopted by ecclesiastics and Conservatives,&mdash;the
&ldquo;National Society for the Education of the Poor in the principles
of the Established Church&rdquo; having been founded in 1811 for its
propagation; while Lancaster&rsquo;s method was patronized by the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, by Whig statesmen, by a few liberal Churchmen
and by Nonconformists generally. It was the design of Lancaster
and his friends to make national education Christian, but not
sectarian,&mdash;to cause the Scriptures to be read, explained and
reverenced in the schools, without seeking by catechisms or otherwise
to attract the children to any particular church or sect. This
principle was at first vehemently denounced as deistic and mischievous,
and as especially hostile to the Established Church. To
do them justice, it must be owned that the rival claims and merits
of Bell and Lancaster were urged with more passion and unfairness
by their friends than by themselves. Yet neither is entitled to
hold a very high place among the world&rsquo;s teachers. Bell was cold,
shrewd and self-seeking. Lancaster had more enthusiasm, a
genuine and abounding love for children, and some ingenuity in
devising plans both for teaching and governing. But he was shiftless,
wayward and unmethodical, and incapable of sustained and
high-principled personal effort. His writings were not numerous.
They consist mainly of short pamphlets descriptive of the successes
he attained at the Borough Road. His last publication, <i>An Epitome
of the Chief Events and Transactions of my Own Life</i>, appeared in
America in 1833, and is characterized, even more strongly than his
former writings, by looseness and incoherency of style, by egotism
and by a curious incapacity for judging fairly the motives either of
his friends or his foes. We have since come to believe that intelligent
teaching requires skill and previous training, and that even the
humblest rudiments are not to be well taught by those who have
only just acquired them for themselves, or to be attained by mere
mechanical drill. But in the early stages of national education the
monitorial method served a valuable purpose. It brought large
numbers of hitherto neglected children under discipline, and gave
them elementary instruction at a very cheap rate. Moreover, the
little monitors were often found to make up in brightness, tractability
and energy for their lack of experience, and to teach the arts
of reading, writing and computing with surprising success. And one
cardinal principle of Bell and Lancaster is of prime importance.
They regarded a school, not merely as a place to which individual
pupils should come for guidance from teachers, but as an organized
community whose members have much to learn from each other.
They sought to place their scholars from the first in helpful mutual
relations, and to make them feel the need of common efforts towards
the attainment of common ends.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANCASTER, THOMAS,<a name="ar31" id="ar31"></a></span> <span class="sc">Earl of</span> (<i>c.</i> 1277-1322), was the
eldest son of Edmund, earl of Lancaster and titular king of
Sicily, and a grandson of the English king, Henry III.; while
he was related to the royal house of France both through his
mother, Blanche, a granddaughter of Louis VIII., and his
step-sister, Jeanne, queen of Navarre, the wife of Philip IV.
A minor when Earl Edmund died in 1296, Thomas received his
father&rsquo;s earldoms of Lancaster and Leicester in 1298, but did
not become prominent in English affairs until after the accession
of his cousin, Edward II., in July 1307. Having married Alice
(d. 1348), daughter and heiress of Henry Lacy, earl of Lincoln,
and added the earldom of Derby to those which he already
held, he was marked out both by his wealth and position as the
leader of the barons in their resistance to the new king. With
his associates he produced the banishment of the royal favourite,
Piers Gaveston, in 1308; compelled Edward in 1310 to surrender
his power to a committee of &ldquo;ordainers,&rdquo; among whom he
himself was numbered; and took up arms when Gaveston
returned to England in January 1312. Lancaster, who had
just obtained the earldoms of Lincoln and Salisbury on the
death of his father-in-law in 1311, drove the king and his favourite
from Newcastle to Scarborough, and was present at the execution
of Gaveston in June 1312. After lengthy efforts at mediation,
he made his submission and received a full pardon from
Edward in October 1313; but he refused to accompany the
king on his march into Scotland, which ended at Bannockburn,
and took advantage of the English disaster to wrest the control
of affairs from the hands of Edward. In 1315 he took command
of the forces raised to fight the Scots, and was soon appointed
to the &ldquo;chief place in the council,&rdquo; while his supporters filled
the great offices of state, but his rule was as feeble as that of the
monarch whom he had superseded. Quarrelling with some of
the barons, he neglected both the government and the defence
of the kingdom, and in 1317 began a private war with John,
Earl Warrenne, who had assisted his countess to escape from
her husband. The capture of Berwick by the Scots, however,
in April 1318 led to a second reconciliation with Edward. A
formal treaty, made in the following August, having been ratified
by parliament, the king and earl opened the siege of Berwick;
but there was no cohesion between their troops, and the undertaking
was quickly abandoned. On several occasions Lancaster
was suspected of intriguing with the Scots, and it is significant
that his lands were spared when Robert Bruce ravaged the north
of England. He refused to attend the councils or to take any
part in the government until 1321, when the Despensers were
banished, and war broke out again between himself and the king.
Having conducted some military operations against Lancaster&rsquo;s
friends on the Welsh marches, Edward led his troops against
the earl, who gradually fell back from Burton-on-Trent to
Pontefract. Continuing this movement, Lancaster reached
Boroughbridge, where he was met by another body of royalists
under Sir Andrew Harclay. After a skirmish he was deserted
by his troops, and was obliged to surrender. Taken to his own
castle at Pontefract, where the king was, he was condemned to
death as a rebel and a traitor, and was beheaded near the town
on the 22nd of March 1322. He left no children.</p>

<p>Although a coarse, selfish and violent man, without any of
the attributes of a statesman, Lancaster won a great reputation
for patriotism; and his memory was long cherished, especially
in the north of England, as that of a defender of popular liberties.
Over a hundred years after his death miracles were said to have
been worked at his tomb at Pontefract; thousands visited his
effigy in St Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, London, and it was even proposed
to make him a saint.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANCASTER,<a name="ar32" id="ar32"></a></span> a market town and municipal borough, river
port, and the county town of Lancashire, England, in the
Lancaster parliamentary division, 230 m. N.W. by N. from
London by the London &amp; North-Western railway (Castle Station);
served also by a branch of the Midland railway (Green Ayre
station). Pop. (1891) 33,256; (1901) 40,329. It lies at the
head of the estuary of the river Lune, mainly on its south bank,
7 m. from the sea. The site slopes sharply up to an eminence
crowned by the castle and the church of St Mary. Fine views
over the rich valley and Morecambe Bay to the west are commanded
from the summit. St Mary&rsquo;s church was originally
attached by Roger de Poictou to his Benedictine priory founded
at the close of the 11th century. It contains some fine Early
English work in the nave arcade, but is of Perpendicular workmanship
in general appearance, while the tower dates from 1759.
There are some beautiful Decorated oak stalls in the chancel,
brought probably from Cockersand or Furness Abbey.</p>

<p>The castle occupies the site of a Roman <i>castrum</i>. The Saxon
foundations of a yet older structure remain, and the tower at
the south-west corner is supposed to have been erected during
the reign of Hadrian. The Dungeon Tower, also supposed to be
of Roman origin, was taken down in 1818. The greater part of
the old portion of the present structure was built by Roger de
Poictou, who utilized some of the Roman towers and the old
walls. In 1322 much damage was done to the castle by Robert
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>149</span>
Bruce, whose attack it successfully resisted, but it was restored
and strengthened by John of Gaunt, who added the greater
part of the Gateway Tower as well as a turret on the keep or
Lungess Tower, which on that account has been named &ldquo;John
o&rsquo; Gaunt&rsquo;s Chair.&rdquo; During the Civil War the castle was captured
by Cromwell. Shortly after this it was put to public use, and
now, largely modernized, contains the assize courts and gaol.
Its appearance, with massive buildings surrounding a quadrangle,
is picturesque and dignified. Without the walls is a pleasant
terrace walk. Other buildings include several handsome modern
churches and chapels (notably the Roman Catholic church); the
Storey Institute with art gallery, technical and art schools,
museum and library, presented to the borough by Sir Thomas
Storey in 1887; Palatine Hall, Ripley hospital (an endowed
school for the children of residents in Lancaster and the neighbourhood),
the asylum, the Royal Lancaster infirmary and an
observatory in the Williamson Park. A new town hall, presented
by Lord Ashton in 1909, is a handsome classical building from
designs of E. W. Mountford. The Ashton Memorial in Williamson
Park, commemorating members of the Ashton family, is
a lofty domed structure. The grammar school occupies modern
buildings, but its foundation dates from the close of the 15th
century, and in its former Jacobean house near the church
William Whewell and Sir Richard Owen were educated. A
horseshoe inserted in the pavement at Horseshoe Corner in the
town, and renewed from time to time, is said to mark the place
where a shoe was cast by John of Gaunt&rsquo;s horse.</p>

<p>The chief industries are cotton-spinning, cabinet-making,
oil cloth-making, railway wagon-building and engineering.
Glasson Dock, 5 m. down the Lune, with a graving dock, is
accessible to vessels of 600 tons. The Kendal and Lancaster
canal reaches the town by an aqueduct over the Lune, which is
also crossed by a handsome bridge dated 1788. The town has
further connexion by canal with Preston. The corporation
consists of a mayor, 8 aldermen and 24 councillors. Area,
3506 acres.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Lancaster (Lone-caster or Lunecastrum) was an
important Roman station, and traces of the Roman fortification
wall remain. The Danes left few memorials of their occupation,
and the Runic Cross found here, once supposed to be Danish, is
now conclusively proved to be Anglo-Saxon. At the Conquest,
the place, reduced in size and with its Roman castrum almost
in ruins, became a possession of Roger de Poictou, who founded
or enlarged the present castle on the old site. The town and
castle had a somewhat chequered ownership till in 1266 they
were granted by Henry III. to his son Edmund, first earl of
Lancaster, and continued to be a part of the duchy of Lancaster
till the present time. A town gathered around the castle, and
in 1193 John, earl of Mertoun, afterwards king, granted it a
charter, and another in 1199 after his accession. Under these
charters the burgesses claimed the right of electing a mayor, of
holding a yearly fair at Michaelmas and a weekly market on
Saturday. Henry III. in 1226 confirmed the charter of 1199;
in 1291 the style of the corporation is first mentioned as <i>Ballivus
et communitas burgi</i>, and Edward III.&rsquo;s confirmation and extension
(1362) is issued to the mayor, bailiffs and commonalty.
Edward III.&rsquo;s charter was confirmed by Richard II. (1389),
Henry IV. (1400), Henry V. (1421), Henry VII. (1488) and
Elizabeth (1563). James I. (1604) and Charles II. (1665 and
1685) ratified, with certain additions, all previous charters, and
again in 1819 a similar confirmation was issued. John of Gaunt
in 1362 obtained a charter for the exclusive right of holding the
sessions of pleas for the county in Lancaster itself, and up to
1873 the duchy appointed a chief justice and a puisne justice
for the court of common pleas at Lancaster. In 1322 the Scots
burnt the town, the castle alone escaping; the town was rebuilt
but removed from its original position on the hill to the slope
and foot. Again in 1389, after the battle of Otterburn, it was
destroyed by the same enemy. At the outbreak of the Great
Rebellion the burgesses sided with the king, and the town and
castle were captured in February 1643 by the Parliamentarians.
In March 1643 Lord Derby assaulted and took the town with
great slaughter, but the castle remained in the hands of the
Parliamentarians. In May and June of the same year the
castle was again besieged in vain, and in 1648 the Royalists
under Sir Thomas Tyldesley once more fruitlessly besieged it.
During the rebellion of 1715 the northern rebels occupied
Lancaster for two days and several of them were later executed
here. During the 1745 rebellion Prince Charles Edward&rsquo;s army
passed through the town in its southward march and again in its
retreat, but the inhabitants stood firm for the Hanoverians.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Two chartered markets are held weekly on Wednesday and
Saturday and three annual fairs in April, July and October. A
merchant gild existed here, which was ratified by Edward III.&rsquo;s
charter (1362), and in 1688 six trade companies were incorporated.
The chief manufactures used to be sailcloth, cabinet furniture,
candles and cordage. The borough returned two members to
parliament from 1295 to 1331 and again from some time in Henry
VIII.&rsquo;s reign before 1529 till 1867, when it was merged in the Lancaster
division of north Lancashire. A church existed here, probably
on the site of the parish church of St Mary&rsquo;s, in Anglo-Saxon times,
but the present church dates from the early 15th century. An act
of parliament was passed in 1792 to make the canal from Kendal
through Lancaster and Preston, which is carried over the Lune about
a mile above Lancaster by a splendid aqueduct.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANCASTER,<a name="ar33" id="ar33"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of Fairfield county,
Ohio, U.S.A., on the Hocking river (non-navigable), about 32 m.
S.E. of Columbus. Pop. (1900) 8991, of whom 442 were foreign-born
and 212 were negroes; (1910 census) 13,093. Lancaster
is served by the Hocking Valley, the Columbus &amp; Southern
and the Cincinnati &amp; Muskingum Valley (Pennsylvania Lines)
railways, and by the electric line of the Scioto Valley Traction
Company, which connects it with Columbus. Near the centre
of the city is Mt. Pleasant, which rises nearly 200 ft. above the
surrounding plain and about which cluster many Indian legends;
with 70 acres of woodland and fields surrounding it, this has
been given to the city for a park. On another hill is the county
court house. Lancaster has a public library and a children&rsquo;s
home; and 6 m. distant is the State Industrial School for Boys.
The manufactures include boots and shoes, glass and agricultural
implements. The total value of the city&rsquo;s factory product in
1905 was $4,159,410, being an increase of 118.3% over that of
1900. Lancaster is the trade centre of a fertile agricultural
region, has good transportation facilities, and is near the Hocking
Valley and Sunday Creek Valley coal-fields; its commercial
and industrial importance increased greatly, after 1900, through
the development of the neighbouring natural gas fields and, after
1907-1908, through the discovery of petroleum near the city.
Good sandstone is quarried in the vicinity. The municipality
owns and operates its waterworks and natural gas plant.
Lancaster was founded in 1800 by Ebenezer Zane (1747-1811),
who received a section of land here as part compensation for
opening a road, known as &ldquo;Zane&rsquo;s Trace,&rdquo; from Wheeling,
West Virginia, to Limestone (now Maysville), Kentucky. Some
of the early settlers were from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, whence
the name. Lancaster was incorporated as a village in 1831 and
twenty years later became a city of the third class.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANCASTER,<a name="ar34" id="ar34"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of Lancaster county,
Pennsylvania, U.S.A., on the Conestoga river, 68 m. W. of
Philadelphia. Pop. (1900) 41,459, of whom 3492 were foreign-born
and 777 were negroes; (1910 census) 47,227. It is
served by the Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia &amp; Reading and
the Lancaster, Oxford &amp; Southern railways, and by tramways of
the Conestoga Traction Company, which had in 1909 a mileage
of 152 m. Lancaster has a fine county court house, a soldiers&rsquo;
monument about 43 ft. in height, two fine hospitals, the Thaddeus
Stevens Industrial School (for orphans), a children&rsquo;s home,
the Mechanics&rsquo; Library, and the Library of the Lancaster
Historical Society. It is the seat of Franklin and Marshall
College (Reformed Church), of the affiliated Franklin and
Marshall Academy, and of the Theological Seminary of the
Reformed Church, conducted in connexion with the college.
The college was founded in 1852 by the consolidation of
Franklin College, founded at Lancaster in 1787, and Marshall
College, founded at Mercersburg in 1836, both of which had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>150</span>
earned a high standing among the educational institutions of
Pennsylvania. Franklin College was named in honour of
Benjamin Franklin, an early patron; Marshall College was
founded by the Reformed Church and was named in honour of
John Marshall. The Theological Seminary was opened in 1825
at Carlisle, Pa., and was removed to York, Pa., in 1829, to
Mercersburg, Pa., in 1837 and to Lancaster in 1871; in 1831
it was chartered by the Pennsylvania legislature. Among its
teachers have been John W. Nevin and Philip Schaff, whose
names, and that of the seminary, are associated with the so-called
&ldquo;Mercersburg Theology.&rdquo; At Millersville, 4 m. S.W. of
Lancaster, is the Second Pennsylvania State Normal School.
At Lancaster are the graves of General John F. Reynolds, who
was born here; Thaddeus Stevens, who lived here after 1842;
and President James Buchanan, who lived for many years on
an estate, &ldquo;Wheatland,&rdquo; near the city and is buried in the
Woodward Hill Cemetery. The city is in a productive tobacco
and grain region, and has a large tobacco trade and important
manufactures. The value of the city&rsquo;s factory products increased
from $12,750,429 in 1900 to $14,647,681 in 1905, or 14.9%.
In 1905 the principal products were umbrellas and canes (valued
at $2,782,879), cigars and cigarettes ($1,951,971), and foundry
and machine-shop products ($1,036,526). Lancaster county has
long been one of the richest agricultural counties in the United
States, its annual products being valued at about $10,000,000;
in 1906 the value of the tobacco crop was about $3,225,000,
and there were 824 manufactories of cigars in the county.</p>

<p>Lancaster was settled about 1717 by English Quakers and
Germans, was laid out as a town in 1730, incorporated as a
borough in 1742, and chartered as a city in 1818. An important
treaty with the Iroquois Indians was negotiated here by the
governor of Pennsylvania and by commissioners from Maryland
and Virginia in June 1744. Some of General Burgoyne&rsquo;s troops,
surrendered at Saratoga, were confined here after the autumn
of 1780. The Continental Congress sat here on the 27th of
September 1777 after being driven from Philadelphia by the
British; and subsequently, after the organization of the Federal
government, Lancaster was one of the places seriously considered
when a national capital was to be chosen. From 1799 to 1812
Lancaster was the capital of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANCE,<a name="ar35" id="ar35"></a></span> a form of spear used by cavalry (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Spear</a></span>). The
use of the lance, dying away on the decay of chivalry and the
introduction of pistol-armed cavalry, was revived by the Polish
and Cossack cavalry who fought against Charles XII. and
Frederick the Great. It was not until Napoleon&rsquo;s time, however,
that lancer regiments appeared in any great numbers on
European battlefields. The effective use of the weapon&mdash;long
before called by Montecucculi the &ldquo;queen of weapons&rdquo;&mdash;by
Napoleon&rsquo;s lancers at Waterloo led to its introduction into the
British service, and except for a short period after the South
African War, in which it was condemned as an anachronism,
it has shared, or rather contested, with the sword the premier
place amongst cavalry arms. In Great Britain and other
countries lances are carried by the front rank of cavalry, except
light cavalry, regiments, as well as by lancer regiments. In
Germany, since 1889, the <i>whole</i> of the cavalry has been armed
with the lance. In Russia, on the other hand, line cavalry
being, until recently, considered as a sort of mounted infantry
or dragoons, the lance was restricted to the Cossacks, and in
Austria it enjoys less favour than in Germany. Altogether
there are few questions of armament or military detail more
freely disputed, in the present day as in the past, than this of
sword <i>versus</i> lance.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The lances used in the British service are of two kinds, those
with ash and those with bamboo staves. The latter are much preferred
and are generally used, the &ldquo;male&rdquo; bamboo being peculiarly
tough and elastic. The lance is provided with a sling, through
which the trooper passes his right arm when the lance is carried slung,
the point of the steel shoe fitting into a bucket attached to the right
stirrup. A small &ldquo;dee&rdquo; loop is also provided, by which the lance
can be attached to the saddle when the trooper dismounts. The
small flag is removed on service. The head is of the best steel.
The Germans, doubtless owing to difficulty in obtaining bamboos, or
ash in large quantity straight enough in the grain over a considerable
length, for lance staves, have adopted a stave of steel tubing
as well as one of pine (figs. 2, 3 and 4).</p>

<p class="pt2">As to the question of the relative efficiency of the lance and the
sword as the principal arm for cavalry, it is alleged that the former
is heavy and fatiguing to carry, conspicuous, and much in the way
when reconnoitring in close country, working through woods and
the like; that, when unslung ready for the charge, it is awkward
to handle, and may be positively dangerous if a horse becomes
restive and the rider has to use both hands on the reins; that unless
the thrust be delivered at full speed, it is easily parried; and, lastly,
that in the <i>mêlée</i>, when the trooper has not room to use his lance,
he will be helpless until he either throws it away or slings it, and
can draw his sword. While admitting the last-mentioned objection,
those who favour the lance contend that success in the first shock
of contact is all-important, and that this success the lancer will
certainly obtain, owing
to his long reach enabling
him to deliver a
blow before the swordsman
can retaliate, while,
when the <i>mêlée</i> commences,
the rear rank
will come to the assistance
of the front rank.
Further, it is claimed
that the power of delivering
the first blow
gives confidence to the
young soldier; that the
appearance of a lancer
regiment, preceded as it
were by a hedge of steel,
has an immense moral
effect; that in single
combat a lancer, with
room to turn, can
always defeat an opponent
armed with a
sword; and, lastly, that
in pursuit a lancer is
terrible to an enemy,
whether the latter be
mounted or on foot. As
in the case of the perennial
argument whether
a sword should be designed
mainly for cutting
or thrusting, it is
unlikely that the dispute
as to the merits of
the lance over the sword
will ever be definitely
settled, since so many
other factors&mdash;horsemanship,
the training of
the horse, the skill and
courage of the adversary&mdash;determine
the
trooper&rsquo;s success quite
as much as the weapon
he happens to wield.
The following passage
from <i>Cavalry: its History
and Tactics</i> (London,
1853), by Captain
Nolan, explains how the
lance gained popularity
in Austria:&mdash;&ldquo;In the
last Hungarian war
(1848-49) the Hungarian
Hussars were ... generally successful against the Austrian heavy
cavalry&mdash;cuirassiers and dragoons; but when they met the Polish
Lancers, the finest regiments of light horse in the Austrian service,
distinguished for their discipline, good riding, and, above all, for their
<i>esprit de corps</i> and gallantry in action, against those the Hungarians
were not successful, and at once attributed this to the lances of
their opponents. The Austrians then extolled the lance above the
sword, and armed all their light cavalry regiments with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lancer regiments in the British service are the 5th, the 9th,
the 12th, the 16th, the 17th and the 21st. All these were converted
at different dates from hussars and light dragoons, the last-named
in 1896. The typical lancer uniform is a light-fitting short-skirted
tunic with a double-breasted front, called the plastron, of a different
colour, a girdle, and a flat-topped lancer &ldquo;cap,&rdquo; adapted from the
Polish czapka (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Uniforms</a></span>: <i>Naval and Military</i>). The British
lancers, with the exception of the 16th, who wear scarlet with blue
facings, are clad in blue, the 5th, 9th and 12th having scarlet facings
and green, black and red plumes respectively, the 17th (famous as the
&ldquo;death or glory boys&rdquo; and wearing a skull and crossbones badge) white
facings and white plume, and the 21st light-blue facings and plume.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANCELOT<a name="ar36" id="ar36"></a></span> (Lancelot du Lac, or Lancelot of the Lake), a
famous figure in the Arthurian cycle of romances. To the great
majority of English readers the name of no knight of King
Arthur&rsquo;s court is so familiar as is that of Sir Lancelot. The
mention of Arthur and the Round Table at once brings him to
mind as the most valiant member of that brotherhood and
the secret lover of the Queen. Lancelot, however, is not an
original member of the cycle, and the development of his story
is still a source of considerable perplexity to the critic.</p>

<p>Briefly summarized, the outline of his career, as given in the
German <i>Lanzelet</i> and the French prose <i>Lancelot</i>, is as follows:
Lancelot was the only child of King Ban of Benoic and his
queen Helaine. While yet an infant, his father was driven
from his kingdom, either by a revolt of his subjects, caused by his
own harshness (<i>Lanzelet</i>), or by the action of his enemy Claudas
de la Deserte (<i>Lancelot</i>). King and queen fly, carrying the
child with them, and while the wife is tending her husband,
who dies of a broken heart on his flight, the infant is carried off
by a friendly water-fairy, the Lady of the Lake, who brings the
boy up in her mysterious kingdom. In the German poem this
is a veritable &ldquo;Isle of Maidens,&rdquo; where no man ever enters, and
where it is perpetual spring. In the prose <i>Lancelot</i>, on the other
hand, the Lake is but a mirage, and the Lady&rsquo;s court does not
lack its complement of gallant knights; moreover the boy has
the companionship of his cousins, Lionel and Bohort, who,
like himself, have been driven from their kingdom by Claudas.
When he reaches the customary age (which appears to be fifteen),
the young Lancelot, suitably equipped, is sent out into the world.
In both versions his name and parentage are concealed, in the
<i>Lanzelet</i> he is genuinely ignorant of both; here too his lack of
all knightly accomplishments (not unnatural when we remember
he has here been brought up entirely by women) and his inability
to handle a steed are insisted upon. Here he rides
forth in search of what adventure may bring. In the prose
<i>Lancelot</i> his education is complete, he knows his name and
parentage, though for some unexplained reason he keeps both
secret, and he goes with a fitting escort and equipment to
Arthur&rsquo;s court to demand knighthood. The subsequent
adventures differ widely: in the <i>Lanzelet</i> he ultimately reconquers
his kingdom, and, with his wife Iblis, reigns over it
in peace, both living to see their children&rsquo;s children, and dying
on the same day, in good old fairy-tale fashion. In fact, the
whole of the <i>Lanzelet</i> has much more the character of a fairy
or folk-tale than that of a knightly romance.</p>

<p>In the prose version, Lancelot, from his first appearance at
court, conceives a passion for the queen, who is very considerably
his senior, his birth taking place some time after her marriage
to Arthur. This infatuation colours all his later career. He
frees her from imprisonment in the castle of Meleagant, who
has carried her off against her will&mdash;(a similar adventure is
related in <i>Lanzelet</i>, where the abductor is Valerîn, and Lanzelet
is not the rescuer)&mdash;and, although he recovers his kingdom from
Claudas, he prefers to remain a simple knight of Arthur&rsquo;s court,
bestowing the lands on his cousins and half-brother Hector.
Tricked into a liaison with the Fisher King&rsquo;s daughter Elaine,
he becomes the father of Galahad, the Grail winner, and, as a
result of the queen&rsquo;s jealous anger at his relations with the lady,
goes mad, and remains an exile from the court for some years.
He takes part, fruitlessly, in the Grail quest, only being vouchsafed
a fleeting glimpse of the sacred Vessel, which, however,
is sufficient to cast him into unconsciousness, in which he remains
for as many days as he has spent years in sin. Finally, his
relations with Guenevere are revealed to Arthur by the sons
of King Lot, Gawain, however, taking no part in the disclosure.
Surprised together, Lancelot escapes, and the queen is condemned
to be burnt alive. As the sentence is about to be carried into
execution Lancelot and his kinsmen come to her rescue, but in
the fight that ensues many of Arthur&rsquo;s knights, including three
of Gawain&rsquo;s brothers, are slain. Thus converted into an enemy,
Gawain urges his uncle to make war on Lancelot, and there
follows a desperate struggle between Arthur and the race of
Ban. This is interrupted by the tidings of Mordred&rsquo;s treachery,
and Lancelot, taking no part in the last fatal conflict, outlives
both king and queen, and the downfall of the Round Table.
Finally, retiring to a hermitage, he ends his days in the odour
of sanctity.</p>

<p>The process whereby the independent hero of the <i>Lanzelet</i>
(who, though his mother is Arthur&rsquo;s sister, has but the slightest
connexion with the British king), the faithful husband of Iblis,
became converted into the principal ornament of Arthur&rsquo;s
court, and the devoted lover of the queen, is by no means easy
to follow, nor do other works of the cycle explain the transformation.
In the pseudo-chronicles, the <i>Historia</i> of Geoffrey
and the translations by Wace and Layamon, Lancelot does not
appear at all; the queen&rsquo;s lover, whose guilty passion is fully
returned, is Mordred. Chrétien de Troyes&rsquo; treatment of him is
contradictory; in the <i>Erec</i>, his earliest extant poem, Lancelot&rsquo;s
name appears as third on the list of the knights of Arthur&rsquo;s
court. (It is well, however, to bear in mind the possibility of
later addition or alteration in such lists.) In <i>Cligés</i> he again
ranks as third, being overthrown by the hero of the poem. In
<i>Le Chevalier de la Charrette</i>, however, which followed <i>Cligés</i>, we
find Lancelot alike as leading knight of the court and lover of
the queen, in fact, precisely in the position he occupies in the
prose romance, where, indeed, the section dealing with this
adventure is, as Gaston Paris clearly proved, an almost literal
adaptation of Chrétien&rsquo;s poem. The subject of the poem is the
rescue of the queen from her abductor Meleagant; and what
makes the matter more perplexing is that Chrétien handles
the situation as one with which his hearers are already familiar;
it is Lancelot, and not Arthur or another, to whom the office of
rescuer naturally belongs. After this it is surprising to find
that in his next poem, <i>Le Chevalier au Lion</i>, Lancelot is once,
and only once, casually referred to, and that in a passing reference
to his rescue of the queen. In the <i>Perceval</i>, Chrétien&rsquo;s
last work, he does not appear at all, and yet much of the action
passes at Arthur&rsquo;s court.</p>

<p>In the continuations added at various times to Chrétien&rsquo;s
unfinished work the rôle assigned to Lancelot is equally modest.
Among the fifteen knights selected by Arthur to accompany
him to Chastel Orguellous he only ranks ninth. In the version
of the <i>Luite Tristran</i> inserted by Gerbert in his <i>Perceval</i>, he is
publicly overthrown and shamed by Tristan. Nowhere is he
treated with anything approaching the importance assigned to
him in the prose versions. Welsh tradition does not know him;
early Italian records, which have preserved the names of Arthur
and Gawain, have no reference to Lancelot; among the group
of Arthurian knights figured on the architrave of the north
doorway of Modena cathedral (a work of the 12th century) he
finds no place; the real cause for his apparently sudden and
triumphant rise to popularity is extremely difficult to determine.
What appears the most probable solution is that which regards
Lancelot as the hero of an independent and widely diffused
folk-tale, which, owing to certain special circumstances, was
brought into contact with, and incorporated in, the Arthurian
tradition. This much has been proved certain of the adventures
recounted in the <i>Lanzelet</i>; the theft of an infant by a water-fairy;
the appearance of the hero three consecutive days, in three
different disguises, at a tournament; the rescue of a queen, or
princess, from an Other-World prison, all belong to one well-known
and widely-spread folk-tale, variants of which are found
in almost every land, and of which numerous examples have been
collected alike by M. Cosquin in his <i>Contes Lorrains</i>, and by
Mr J. F. Campbell in his <i>Tales of the West Highlands</i>.</p>

<p>The story of the loves of Lancelot and Guenevere, as related
by Chrétien, has about it nothing spontaneous and genuine; in
no way can it be compared with the story of Tristan and Iseult.
It is the exposition of a relation governed by artificial and
arbitrary rules, to which the principal actors in the drama
must perforce conform. Chrétien states that he composed the
poem (which he left to be completed by Godefroi de Leigni)
at the request of the countess Marie of Champagne, who provided
him with <i>matière et san</i>. Marie was the daughter of Louis VII.
of France and of Eleanor of Aquitaine, subsequently wife of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>152</span>
Henry II. of Anjou and England. It is a matter of history that
both mother and daughter were active agents in fostering that
view of the social relations of the sexes which found its most
famous expression in the &ldquo;Courts of Love,&rdquo; and which was
responsible for the dictum that love between husband and wife
was impossible. The logical conclusion appears to be that the
<i>Charrette</i> poem is a &ldquo;<i>Tendenz-Schrift</i>,&rdquo; composed under certain
special conditions, in response to a special demand. The story
of <i>Tristan and Iseult</i>, immensely popular as it was, was too
genuine&mdash;(shall we say too crude?)&mdash;to satisfy the taste of the
court for which Chrétien was writing. Moreover, the Arthurian
story was the popular story of the day, and Tristan did not
belong to the magic circle, though he was ultimately introduced,
somewhat clumsily, it must be admitted, within its bounds.
The Arthurian cycle must have its own love-tale; Guenevere,
the leading lady of that cycle, could not be behind the courtly
ladies of the day and lack a lover; one had to be found for her.
Lancelot, already popular hero of a tale in which an adventure
parallel to that of the <i>Charrette</i> figured prominently, was pressed
into the service, Modred, Guenevere&rsquo;s earlier lover, being too
unsympathetic a character; moreover, Modred was required for
the final rôle of traitor.</p>

<p>But to whom is the story to be assigned? Here we must
distinguish between the <i>Lancelot</i> proper and the <i>Lancelot-Guenevere</i>
versions; so far as the latter are concerned, we cannot
get behind the version of Chrétien,&mdash;nowhere, prior to the
composition of the <i>Chevalier de la Charrette</i> is there any evidence
of the existence of such a story. Yet Chrétien does not claim to
have invented the situation. Did it spring from the fertile
brain of some court lady, Marie, or another? The authorship
of the <i>Lancelot</i> proper, on the other hand, is invariably ascribed
to Walter Map (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Map</a></span>), the chancellor of Henry II., but so
also are the majority of the Arthurian prose Romances. The
trend of modern critical opinion is towards accepting Map as the
author of a <i>Lancelot</i> romance, which formed the basis for later
developments, and there is a growing tendency to identify
this hypothetical original <i>Lancelot</i> with the source of the German
<i>Lanzelet</i>. The author, Ulrich von Zatzikhoven, tells us that he
translated his poem from a French (<i>welsches</i>) book in the possession
of Hugo de Morville, one of the English hostages, who, in
1194, replaced Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion in the prison of Leopold
of Austria. Further evidence on the point is, unfortunately,
not at present forthcoming. To the student of the original texts
Lancelot is an infinitely less interesting hero than Gawain,
Perceval or Tristan, each of whom possesses a well-marked
personality, and is the centre of what we may call individual
adventures. Saving and excepting the incident of his being
stolen and brought up by a water-fairy (from a <i>Lai</i> relating
which adventure the whole story probably started), there is
absolutely nothing in Lancelot&rsquo;s character or career to distinguish
him from any other romantic hero of the period. The
language of the prose <i>Lancelot</i> is good, easy and graceful, but
the adventures lack originality and interest, and the situations
repeat themselves in a most wearisome manner. English readers,
who know the story only through the medium of Malory&rsquo;s noble
prose and Tennyson&rsquo;s melodious verse, carry away an impression
entirely foreign to that produced by a study of the original
literature. The <i>Lancelot</i> story, in its rise and development,
belongs exclusively to the later stage of Arthurian romance;
it was a story for the court, not for the folk, and it lacks alike
the dramatic force and human appeal of the genuine &ldquo;popular&rdquo;
tale.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The prose <i>Lancelot</i> was frequently printed; J. C. Brunet chronicles
editions of 1488, 1494, 1513, 1520 and 1533&mdash;of this last date there
are two, one published by Jehan Petit, the other by Philippe Lenoire,
this last by far the better, being printed from a much fuller manuscript.
There is no critical edition, and the only version available
for the general reader is the modernized and abridged text published
by Paulin Paris in vols. iii. to v. of <i>Romans de la Table Ronde</i>.
A Dutch verse translation of the 13th century was published by
M. W. J. A. Jonckbloet in 1850, under the title of <i>Roman van Lanceloet</i>.
This only begins with what Paulin Paris terms the <i>Agravain</i>
section, all the part previous to Guenevere&rsquo;s rescue from Meleagant
having been lost; but the text is an excellent one, agreeing closely
with the Lenoire edition of 1533. The Books devoted by Malory to
Lancelot are also drawn from this latter section of the romance;
there is no sign that the English translator had any of the earlier
part before him. Malory&rsquo;s version of the <i>Charrette</i> adventure differs
in many respects from any other extant form, and the source of this
special section of his work is still a question of debate among scholars.
The text at his disposal, especially in the <i>Queste</i> section, must have
been closely akin to that used by the Dutch translator and the
compiler of Lenoire, 1533. Unfortunately, Dr Sommer, in his study
on the <i>Sources of Malory</i>, omitted to consult these texts, with the
result that the sections dealing with <i>Lancelot</i> and <i>Queste</i> urgently
require revision.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANCEWOOD,<a name="ar38" id="ar38"></a></span> a straight-grained, tough, light elastic wood
obtained from the West Indies and Guiana. It is brought into
commerce in the form of taper poles of about 20 ft. in length
and from 6 to 8 in. in diameter at the thickest end. Lancewood
is used by carriage-builders for shafts; but since the practice of
employing curved shafts has come largely into use it is not in
so great demand as formerly. The smaller wood is used for
whip-handles, for the tops of fishing-rods, and for various minor
purposes where even-grained elastic wood is a desideratum.
The wood is obtained from two members of the natural order
Anonaceae. The black lancewood or carisiri of Guiana (<i>Guatteria
virgata</i>) grows to a height of 50 ft., is of remarkably slender
form, and seldom yields wood more than 8 in. diameter. The
yellow lancewood tree (<i>Duguetia quitarensis</i>, yari-yari, of Guiana)
is of similar dimensions, found in tolerable abundance throughout
Guiana, and used by the Indians for arrow-points, as well as
for spars, beams, &amp;c.</p>

and 12 m. S.E. of Chieti. Pop. (1901) 7642 (town), 18,316
(commune). It has a railway station on the coast railway, 19 m.
S.E. of Castellammare Adriatico. It has broad, regular streets,
and several fine buildings. The cathedral, an imposing structure
with a fine clock-tower of 1619, is built upon bridges of brickwork,
dating perhaps from the Roman period (though the inscription
attributing the work to Diocletian is a forgery), that span the
gorge of the Feltrino, and is dedicated to S. Maria del Ponte,
Our Lady of the Bridge. The Gothic church of S. Maria Maggiore
dates from 1227 and has a fine façade, with a portal of 1317
by a local sculptor. The processional cross by the silversmith
Nicola di Guardiagrele (1422) is very beautiful. In S. Nicola
is a fine reliquary of 1445 by Nicola di Francavilla. The church
of the Annunziata has a good rose window of 1362. The
industries of the town, famous in the middle ages, have declined.
Anxanum belonged originally to the tribe of the Frentani and

<p><span class="bold">LANCRET, NICOLAS<a name="ar41" id="ar41"></a></span> (1660-1743), French painter, was born
in Paris on the 22nd of January 1660, and became a brilliant
depicter of light comedy which reflected the tastes and manners
of French society under the regent Orleans. His first master
was Pierre d&rsquo;Ulin, but his acquaintance with and admiration
for Watteau induced him to leave d&rsquo;Ulin for Gillot, whose pupil
Watteau had been. Two pictures painted by Lancret and
exhibited on the Place Dauphine had a great success, which
laid the foundation of his fortune, and, it is said, estranged
Watteau, who had been complimented as their author. Lancret&rsquo;s
work cannot now, however, be taken for that of Watteau, for
both in drawing and in painting his touch, although intelligent,
is dry, hard and wanting in that quality which distinguished his
great model; these characteristics are due possibly in part to
the fact that he had been for some time in training under an
engraver. The number of his paintings (of which over eighty
have been engraved) is immense; he executed a few portraits
and attempted historical composition, but his favourite subjects
were balls, fairs, village weddings, &amp;c. The British Museum
possesses an admirable series of studies by Lancret in red chalk,
and the National Gallery, London, shows four paintings&mdash;the
&ldquo;Four Ages of Man&rdquo; (engraved by Desplaces and l&rsquo;Armessin),
cited by d&rsquo;Argenville amongst the principal works of Lancret.
In 1719 he was received as Academician, and became councillor
in 1735; in 1741 he married a grandchild of Boursault, author
of <i>Aesop at Court</i>. He died on the 14th of September 1743.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAND,<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span> the general term for that part of the earth&rsquo;s surface
which is solid and dry as opposed to sea or water. The word
is common to Teutonic languages, mainly in the same form and
with essentially the same meaning. The Celtic cognate forms
are Irish <i>lann</i>, Welsh <i>llan</i>, an enclosure, also in the sense of
&ldquo;church,&rdquo; and so of constant occurrence in Welsh place-names,
Cornish <i>lan</i> and Breton <i>lann</i>, health, which has given the French
<i>lande</i>, an expanse or tract of sandy waste ground. The ultimate
root is unknown. From its primary meaning have developed
naturally the various uses of the word, for a tract of ground or
country viewed either as a political, geographical or ethnographical
division of the earth, as property owned by the public
or state or by a private individual, or as the rural as opposed to
the urban or the cultivated as opposed to the built on part of
the country; of particular meanings may be mentioned that of
a building divided into tenements or flats, the divisions being
known as &ldquo;houses,&rdquo; a Scottish usage, and also that of a division
of a ploughed field marked by the irrigating channels, hence
transferred to the smooth parts of the bore of a rifle between the
grooves of the rifling.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANDAU,<a name="ar43" id="ar43"></a></span> a town in the Bavarian Palatinate, on the Queich,
lying under the eastern slope of the Hardt Mountains, 32 m.
by rail S.W. from Mannheim, at the junction of lines to Neustadt
an der Hardt, Weissenburg and Saarbrücken. Pop. (1905)
17,165. Among its buildings are the Gothic Evangelical church,
dating from 1285; the chapel of St Catherine built in 1344;
the church of the former Augustinian monastery, dating from
1405; and the Augustinian monastery itself, founded in 1276
and now converted into a brewery. There are manufactures of
cigars, beer, hats, watches, furniture and machines, and a trade
in wine, fruit and cereals. Large cattle-markets are held here.
Landau was founded in 1224, becoming an imperial city fifty
years later. This dignity was soon lost, as in 1317 it passed to
the bishopric of Spires and in 1331 to the Palatinate, recovering
its former position in 1511. Captured eight times during the
Thirty Years&rsquo; War the town was ceded to France by the treaty
of Westphalia in 1648, although with certain ill-defined reservations.
In 1679 Louis XIV. definitely took possession of Landau.
Its fortifications were greatly strengthened; nevertheless it
was twice taken by the Imperialists and twice recovered by the
French during the Spanish Succession War. In 1815 it was
given to Austria and in the following year to Bavaria. The
fortifications were finally dismantled in 1871.</p>

<p>The town is commonly supposed to have given its name to
the four-wheeled carriage, with an adjustable divided top for
use either open or closed, known as a &ldquo;landau&rdquo; (Ger.
<i>Landauer</i>). But this derivation is doubtful, the origin of the
name being also ascribed to that of an English carriage-builder,
Landow, who introduced this form of equipage.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANDEN, JOHN<a name="ar45" id="ar45"></a></span> (1719-1790), English mathematician, was
born at Peakirk near Peterborough in Northamptonshire on
the 23rd of January 1719, and died on the 15th of January
1790 at Milton in the same county. He lived a very retired
life, and saw little or nothing of society; when he did mingle
in it, his dogmatism and pugnacity caused him to be generally
shunned. In 1762 he was appointed agent to the Earl Fitzwilliam,
and held that office to within two years of his death.
He was first known as a mathematician by his essays in the
<i>Ladies&rsquo; Diary</i> for 1744. In 1766 he was elected a fellow of the
Royal Society. He was well acquainted with the works of the
mathematicians of his own time, and has been called the
&ldquo;English d&rsquo;Alembert.&rdquo; In his <i>Discourse</i> on the &ldquo;Residual
Analysis,&rdquo; he proposes to avoid the metaphysical difficulties
of the method of fluxions by a purely algebraical method. The
idea may be compared with that of Joseph Louis Lagrange&rsquo;s
<i>Calcul des Fonctions</i>. His memoir (1775) on the rotatory
motion of a body contains (as the author was aware) conclusions
at variance with those arrived at by Jean le Rond, d&rsquo;Alembert
and Leonhard Euler in their researches on the same subject.
He reproduces and further develops and defends his own views
in his <i>Mathematical Memoirs</i>, and in his paper in the <i>Philosophical
Transactions</i> for 1785. But Landen&rsquo;s capital discovery is that
of the theorem known by his name (obtained in its complete
form in the memoir of 1775, and reproduced in the first volume
of the <i>Mathematical Memoirs</i>) for the expression of the arc of
an hyperbola in terms of two elliptic arcs. His researches on
elliptic functions are of considerable elegance, but their great
merit lies in the stimulating effect which they had on later
mathematicians. He also showed that the roots of a cubic
equation can be derived by means of the infinitesimal calculus.</p>

<p>The list of his writings is as follows:&mdash;<i>Ladies&rsquo; Diary</i>, various communications
(1744-1760); papers in the <i>Phil. Trans.</i> (1754, 1760,

<p><span class="bold">LANDER, RICHARD LEMON<a name="ar47" id="ar47"></a></span> (1804-1834) and <span class="bold">JOHN</span> (1807-1839),
English explorers of the Niger, were natives of Cornwall,
sons of an innkeeper at Truro. At the age of eleven Richard
went to the West Indies in the service of a merchant. Returning
to England after an absence of three years he took service with
various wealthy families, with whom he travelled on the continent.
In 1823-1824 he accompanied Major (afterwards General Sir)
W. M. Colebrooke, on a tour through Cape Colony. In 1825
Richard offered his services to Hugh Clapperton, then preparing
for his second expedition to West Africa. He was Clapperton&rsquo;s
devoted servant and companion in this expedition, and on
Clapperton&rsquo;s death near Sokoto in April 1827 Richard Lander,
after visiting Kano and other parts of the Hausa states, returned
to the Guinea coast through Yoruba bringing with him Clapperton&rsquo;s
journal. To this on its publication (1829) was added
<i>The Journal of Richard Lander from Kano to the Coast</i>, and in
the next year Lander published another account of the expedition
entitled <i>Records of Captain Clapperton&rsquo;s Last Expedition
to Africa ... with the subsequent Adventures of the Author</i>.
To this narrative he prefixed an autobiographical note. Richard
Lander, though without any scientific attainments, had exhibited
such capacity for exploration that the British government
decided to send him out to determine the course of the lower
Niger. In the expedition he was accompanied by his brother
John, by trade a printer, and better educated than Richard, who
went as an unsalaried volunteer. Leaving England in January
1830, the brothers landed at Badagry on the Guinea coast on
the 22nd of March. They then travelled by the route previously
taken by Clapperton to Bussa on the right bank of the Niger,
reached on the 17th of June. Thence they ascended the river
for about 100 m. Going back to Bussa the travellers began,
on the 20th of September, the descent of the river, not knowing
whither it would lead them. They journeyed in canoes accompanied
by a few negroes, their only scientific instrument a common
compass. They discovered the Benue river, ascertaining when
passing its confluence, by paddling against its stream, that their
course was not in that direction. At the beginning of the delta
they were captured by the Ibos, from whom they were ransomed
by &ldquo;King Boy&rdquo; of Brass Town; by him they were taken to
the Nun mouth of the river, whence a passage was obtained to
Fernando Po, reached on the 1st of December. The Landers
were thus able to lay down with approximate correctness the
lower course of the Niger&mdash;a matter till then as much in dispute
as was the question of the Nile sources. In the attack by the
Ibos the Landers lost many of their records, but they published
a narrative of their discoveries in 1832, in three small volumes&mdash;<i>Journal
of an Expedition to Explore the Course and Termination
of the Niger</i>. In recognition of his services the Royal Geographical
Society&mdash;formed two years previously&mdash;granted Richard Lander
in 1832 the royal medal, he being the first recipient of such an
award. In the same year Richard went to Africa again as
leader of an expedition organized by Macgregor Laird and other
Liverpool merchants to open up trade on the Niger and to found
a commercial settlement at the junction of the Benue with the
main stream. The expedition encountered many difficulties,
suffered great mortality from fever, and was not able to reach
Bussa. Lander made several journeys up and down stream,
and while going up the river in a canoe was attacked by the
natives on the 20th of January 1834 at a spot about 84 m.
above the Nun mouth, and wounded by a musket ball in the
thigh. He was removed to Fernando Po, where he died on the
6th of February. John Lander, who on his return to England
in 1831 obtained a situation at the London customs house,
died on the 16th of November 1839 of a disease contracted
in Africa.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANDES,<a name="ar48" id="ar48"></a></span> a department in the south-west of France, formed
in 1790 of portions of the ancient provinces of Guyenne (Landes,
Condomios Chalosse), Gascony and Béarn, and bounded N. by
Gironde, E. by Lot-et-Garonne and Gers, S. by Basses Pyrenées,
and W. (for 68 m.) by the Bay of Biscay. Pop. (1906) 293,397.
Its area, 3615 sq. m., is second only to that of the department of
Gironde. The department takes its name from the <i>Landes</i>,
which occupy three-quarters of its surface, or practically the
whole region north of the Adour, the chief river of the department.
They are separated from the sea by a belt of dunes
fringed on the east by a chain of lakes. South of the Adour lies
the Chalosse&mdash;a hilly region, intersected by the Gabas, Luy and
Gave de Pau, left-hand tributaries of the Adour, which descend
from the Pyrenees. On the right the Adour is joined by the
Midouze, formed by the junction of the Douze and the Midou.
The climate of Landes is the Girondine, which prevails from
the Loire to the Pyrenees. Snow is almost unknown, the spring is
rainy, the summer warm and stormy. The prevailing wind is the
south-west, and the mean temperature of the year is 53° F., the
thermometer hardly ever rising above 82° or falling below 14°.
The annual rainfall in the south of the department in the neighbourhood
of the sea reaches 55 in., but diminishes by more than
half towards the north-east.</p>

<p>The fertility of La Chalosse is counterbalanced by the comparative
poorness of the soil of the Landes, and small though the
population is, the department does not produce wheat enough
for its own consumption. The chief cereal is maize; next in
importance are rye, wheat and millet. Of vegetables, the bean
is most cultivated. The vine is grown in the Chalosse, sheep are
numerous, and the &ldquo;Landes&rdquo; breed of horses is well known.
Forests, chiefly composed of pines, occupy more than half the
department, and their exploitation forms the chief industry.
The resin of the maritime pine furnishes by distillation essence
of turpentine, and from the residue are obtained various qualities
of resin, which serve to make varnish, tapers, sealing-wax
and lubricants. Tar, and an excellent charcoal for smelting
purposes, are also obtained from the pine-wood. The department
has several mineral springs, the most important being those
of Dax, which were frequented in the time of the Romans, and
of Eugénie-les-Bains and Préchacq. The cultivation of the cork
tree is also important. There are salt-workings and stone
quarries. There are several iron-works in the department;
those at Le Boucau, at the mouth of the Adour, are the most
important. There are also saw-mills, distilleries, flour-mills,
brick and tile works and potteries. Exports include resinous
products, pine-timber, metal, brandy; leading imports are grain,
coal, iron, millinery and furniture. In its long extent of coast
the department has no considerable port. Opposite Cape Breton,
however, where the Adour formerly entered the sea, there is,
close to land, a deep channel where there is safe anchorage. It
was from this once important harbour of Capbreton that the
discoverers of the Canadian island of that name set out. Landes
includes three arrondissements (Mont-de-Marsan, Dax and St
Sever), 28 cantons and 334 communes.</p>

<p>Mont-de-Marsan is the capital of the department, which comes
within the circumscription of the appeal court of Pau, the académie
(educational division) of Bordeaux and the archbishopric of Auch,
and forms part of the region of the 18th army corps. It is served
by the Southern railway; there is some navigation on the
Adour, but that upon the other rivers is of little importance.
Mont-de-Marsan, Dax, St Sever and Aire-sur-l&rsquo;Adour, the most
noteworthy towns, receive separate notice. Hagetmau has a
church built over a Romanesque crypt, the roof of which is
supported on columns with elaborately-carved capitals. Sorde
has an interesting abbey-church of the 13th and 14th centuries.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANDES,<a name="ar49" id="ar49"></a></span> an extensive natural region of south-western France,
known more strictly as the Landes de Gascogne. It has an area
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>155</span>
of 5400 sq. m., and occupies three-quarters of the department of
Landes, half of that of Gironde, and some 175,000 acres of Lot-et-Garonne.
The Landes, formerly a vast tract of moorland and
marsh, now consist chiefly of fields and forests of pines. They
form a plateau, shaped like a triangle, the base of which is the
Atlantic coast while the apex is situated slightly west of Nérac
(Lot-et-Garonne). Its limits are, on the S. the river Adour;
on the E. the hills of Armagnac, Eauzan, Condomois, Agenais
and Bazadais; and on the N.E. the Garonne, the hills of Médoc
and the Gironde. The height of the plateau ranges in general
from 130 to 260 ft.; the highest altitude (498 ft.) is found in the
east near Baudignan (department of Landes), from which point
there is a gradual slope towards north, south, east and west.
The soil is naturally sterile. It is composed of fine sand resting
on a subsoil of tufa (<i>alios</i>) impermeable by water; for three-quarters
of the year, consequently, the waters, settling on the
almost level surface and unable to filter through, used to transform
the country into unwholesome swamps, which the Landesats
could only traverse on stilts. About the middle of the 18th
century an engineer, François Chambrelent, instituted a scheme
of draining and planting to remedy these evils. As a result
about 1600 m. of ditches have been dug which carry off superficial
water either to streams or to the lakes which fringe the landes on
the west, and over 1,600,000 acres have been planted with
maritime pines and oaks. The coast, for a breadth of about
4 m., and over an area of about 225,000 acres, is bordered by
dunes, in ranges parallel to the shore, and from 100 to 300 ft.
in height. Driven by the west wind, which is most frequent in
these parts, the dunes were slowly advancing year by year
towards the east, burying the cultivated lands and even the
houses. Nicolas Thomas Brémontier, towards the end of the
18th century, devised the plan of arresting this scourge by planting
the dunes with maritime pines. Upwards of 210,000 acres
have been thus treated. In the south-west, cork trees take the
place of the pines. To prevent the formation of fresh dunes, a
&ldquo;dune littorale&rdquo; has been formed by means of a palisade.
This barrier, from 20 to 30 ft. high, presents an obstacle which
the sand cannot cross. On the eastern side of the dunes is a
series of lakes (Hourtin et Carcans, Lacanau, Cazau or Sanguinet,
Biscarrosse, Aureilhan, St Julien, Léon and Soustons) separated
from the sea by the heaping up of the sand. The salt water has
escaped by defiltration, and they are now quite fresh. The
Basin of Arcachon, which lies midway between the lakes of
Lacanau and Cazau, still communicates with the ocean, the
current of the Leyre which flows into it having sufficient force
to keep a passage open.</p>

times of the Holy Roman Empire. It originally signified a
count of more than usual power or dignity, and in some cases
implied sovereignty. The title is now rare; it is borne by the
former sovereign of Hesse-Homburg, now incorporated in Prussia,
the heads of the various branches of the house of Hesse, and by a
branch of the family of Fürstenberg. In other cases the title of
landgrave is borne by German sovereigns as a subsidiary title;

<p><span class="bold">LANDLORD AND TENANT.<a name="ar52" id="ar52"></a></span> In <i>Roman Law</i>, the relationship
of landlord and tenant arose from the contract of letting and
hiring (<i>locatio conductio</i>), and existed also with special incidents,
under the forms of tenure known as <i>emphyteusis</i>&mdash;the long lease of
Roman law&mdash;and <i>precarium</i>, or tenancy at will (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Roman Law</a></span>).</p>

<p><i>Law of England.</i>&mdash;The law of England&mdash;and the laws of
Scotland and Ireland agree with it on this point&mdash;recognizes
no absolute private ownership of land. The absolute and
ultimate owner of all land is the crown, and the highest interest
that a subject can hold therein&mdash;viz. an estate in fee simple&mdash;is
only a tenancy. But this aspect of the law, under which the
landlord, other than the crown, is himself always a tenant,
falls beyond the scope of the present article, which is restricted
to those holdings that arise from the hiring and leasing of land.</p>

<p>The legal relationship of landlord and tenant is constituted
by a lease, or an agreement for a lease, by assignment, by attornment
and by estoppel. And first of a lease and an
agreement for a lease. All kinds of interests and
<span class="sidenote">Leases.</span>
property, whether corporeal, such as lands or buildings, or
incorporeal, such as rights of common or of way, may be let.
The Benefices Act 1898, however, now prohibits the grant of a
lease of an advowson. Titles of honour, offices of trust or relating
to the administration of justice, and pensions granted by the
crown for military services are also inalienable. Generally
speaking, any person may grant or take a lease. But there
are a number of common-law and statutory qualifications and
exceptions. A lease by or to an infant is voidable at his option.
But extensive powers of leasing the property of infants have been
created by the Settled Estates Act 1877 and the Settled Land
Act 1882. A person of unsound mind can grant or take a lease
if he is capable of contracting. Leases may be made on behalf
of lunatics subject to the jurisdiction in lunacy under the provisions
of the Lunacy Act 1890 and the Settled Land Act 1882.
A married woman can lease her &ldquo;separate property&rdquo; apart
from or under the Married Women&rsquo;s Property Acts, as if she
were a single woman (<i>feme sole</i>). As regards other property,
the concurrence of her husband is generally necessary. An
alien was, at common law, incapable of being either a lessor or
a lessee. But this disqualification is removed by the Naturalization
Act 1870. The right to deal with the property of a convict
while he is undergoing sentence (but not while he is out of prison
on leave) is, by the Forfeiture Act 1870, vested in his administrator.
Leases by or to corporations must be by deed under
their common seal, and the leasing powers of ecclesiastical
corporations in particular are subject to complicated statutory
restrictions which cannot here be examined (see Phillimore,
<i>Eccl. Law</i>, 2nd ed., p. 1281). Powers of granting building and
other leases have been conferred by modern legislation on municipal
corporations and other local <span class="correction" title="amended from authorites">authorities</span>.</p>

<p>A person having an interest in land can, in general, create a
valid interest only to the extent of that interest. Thus a tenant
for years, or even from year to year only, may stand in his
turn as landlord to another tenant. If he profess, however, to
create a tenancy for a period longer than that to which his own
interest extends, he does not thereby give to his tenant an
interest available against the reversioner or remainder man.
The subtenant&rsquo;s interest will expire with the interest of the
person who created it. But as between the subtenant and his
immediate lessor the subtenancy will be good, and should the
interest of the lessor become greater than it was when the
subtenancy was created the subtenant will have the benefit of it.
On his side, again, the subtenant, by accepting that position, is
estopped from denying that his lessor&rsquo;s title (whatever it be) is
good. There are also special rules of law with reference to leases
by persons having only a limited interest in the property leased,
<i>e.g.</i> a tenant for life under the Settled Land Acts, or a mortgagor
or mortgagee.</p>

<p><i>The Letting.</i>&mdash;To constitute the relationship of landlord and
tenant in the mode under consideration, it is necessary not
only that there should be parties capable of entering into the
contract, but that there should be a letting, as distinct from a
mere agreement to let, and that the right conveyed should be a
right to the exclusive possession of the subject of the letting
and not a simple licence to use it. Whether a particular instrument
is a lease, or an agreement for a lease, or a bare licence, is a
question the answer to which depends to a large extent on the
circumstances of individual cases; and the only general rule
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>156</span>
is that in a lease there must be an expression of intention on the
part of the lessor to convey, and of the lessee to accept, the
exclusive possession of the thing let for the prescribed term and
on the prescribed conditions. The landlord must not part with
the whole of his interest, since, if he does so, the instrument is
not a lease but an assignment. Where a tenant enters under an
agreement for a lease and pays rent, the agreement will be
regarded as a lease from year to year; and if the agreement is
one of which specific performance would be decreed (<i>i.e.</i> if it
contains a complete contract between the parties and satisfies
the provisions&mdash;to be noted immediately&mdash;of the Statute of
Frauds, and if, in all the circumstances, its enforcement is just
and equitable), the lessee is treated as having a lease for the term
fixed in the agreement from the time that he took possession
under it, just as if a valid lease had been executed. At common
law a lease for a term of years (other than a lease by a corporation)
might be made by parol. But under the Statute of Frauds (1677,
ss., 1, 2) leases, except those the term of which does not exceed
three years, and in which the reserved rent is equal to two-thirds
at least of the improved value of the premises, were required to be
in writing signed by the parties or their lawfully authorized
agents; and, under the Real Property Act 1845, a lease required
by law to be in writing is void unless made by deed. The
Statute of Frauds also prohibits an action from being brought
upon any agreement for a lease, for any term, unless such
agreement is in writing and signed by the party to be charged
therewith or by some agent lawfully authorized by him.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Forms of Tenancy.</i>&mdash;The following are the principal forms of
tenancy: (i.) <i>Tenancy for Life.</i>&mdash;A lease for life must be made by
deed, and the term may be the life of the lessee and the life or lives
of some other person or persons, and in the latter case either for their
joint lives or for the life of the survivor; also for the lives of the
lessee himself and of some other person or persons, and this constitutes
a single estate. A tenant for life under a settlement has
extensive powers of leasing under the Settled Land Act 1882. He
may lease the settled land, or any part of it, for any time not exceeding
(<i>a</i>) in the case of a building lease, 99 years; (<i>b</i>) in the case
of a mining lease, 60 years, (<i>c</i>) in the case of any other lease, 21 years.
He may also grant either a lease of the surface of settled land, reserving
the mines and minerals, or a lease of the minerals without the
surface. A lease under the Settled Land Act 1882 must be by deed
and must be made to take effect in possession not later than 12
months after its date; the best rent that can reasonably be obtained
must be reserved and the lease must contain a covenant by the
lessee for payment of the rent, and a condition of re-entry on non-payment
within a specified time not exceeding 30 days, (ii.) <i>Tenancy
for Years</i>, <i>i.e.</i> for a term of years.&mdash;This tenancy is created by an
express contract between the parties and never by implication, as
in the case of tenancy from year to year and tenancy at will. Here
the tenancy ends on the expiry of the prescribed term, without notice
to quit or any other formality. (iii.) <i>Tenancy from Year to Year.</i>&mdash;This
tenancy may be created by express agreement between the
parties, or by implication as, <i>e.g.</i> where a person enters and pays
rent under a lease for years, void either by law or by statute, or
without any actual lease or agreement, or holds over after the
determination of a lease whether for years or otherwise. In the
absence of express agreement or custom or statutory provision (such
as is made by the Agricultural Holdings Act 1883), a tenancy from
year to year is determinable on half a year&rsquo;s notice expiring at the
end of some current year of the tenancy. Where there is no express
stipulation creating a yearly tenancy, if the parties have contracted
that the tenant may be dispossessed by a notice given at any time,
effect will be given to this provision. The common law doctrine of a
six months&rsquo; notice being required to terminate a tenancy from year
to year of a corporeal hereditament, does not apply to an incorporeal
hereditament such as a right to shoot. (iv.) <i>Tenancies for Shorter
Periods.</i>&mdash;Closely associated with tenancies from year to year are
various other tenancies for shorter periods than a year&mdash;weekly,
monthly or quarterly. Questions of considerable importance
frequently arise as to the notice necessary to terminate tenancies
of this character. The issue is one of fact; the date at which the
rent is payable is a material circumstance, but it may be said generally
that a week&rsquo;s notice should be given to determine a weekly tenancy, a
month&rsquo;s to determine a monthly tenancy, and a quarter&rsquo;s to determine
a quarterly tenancy. It is chiefly in connexion with the letting
of lodgings, flats, &amp;c., that tenancies of this class arise (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Flats</a></span>,
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lodger and Lodgings</a></span>). (v.) <i>Tenancy at Will.</i>&mdash;A tenancy at will
is one which endures at the will of the parties only, <i>i.e.</i> at the will
of both, for if a demise be made to hold at the will of the lessor, the
law implies that it is at the will of the lessee also and vice versa.
Any signification of a desire to terminate the tenancy, whether
expressed as &ldquo;notice&rdquo; or not, will bring it to an end. This form of
tenancy, like tenancy from year to year, may be treated either by
express contract or by implication, as where premises are occupied
with the consent of the owner, but without any express or implied
agreement as to the duration of the tenancy, or where a house is lent
rent free by one person to another. A tenancy at will is determined
by either party alienating his interest as soon as such alienation
comes to the knowledge of the other. (vi.) <i>Tenancy at Sufferance.</i>&mdash;A
tenant who comes into possession by a lawful demise, but &ldquo;holds
over&rdquo; or continues in possession after his estate is ended, is said to be
a &ldquo;tenant at sufferance.&rdquo; Properly speaking, tenancy at sufferance
is not a tenancy at all, inasmuch as if the landlord acquiesces in it,
it becomes a tenancy at will; and it is to be regarded merely as a
legal fiction which prevented the rightful owner from treating the
tenant as a trespasser until he had himself made an actual entry on
or had brought an action to recover the land. The Distress for
Rent Act 1737, however, enables a landlord to recover double rent
from a tenant who holds over after having himself given notice to
quit; while another statute in the reign of George II.&mdash;the Landlord
and Tenant Act 1730&mdash;makes a tenant who holds over after
receiving a notice from his landlord liable to the extent of double the
value of the premises. There is no tenancy by sufferance against
the crown.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Form of a Lease.</i>&mdash;The component parts of a lease are the
parties, the recitals (when necessary) setting out such matters
as the title of the lessor; the demise or actual letting (the word
&ldquo;demise&rdquo; is ordinarily used, but any term indicating an express
intention to make a present letting is sufficient); the parcels
in which the extent of the premises demised is stated; the
<i>habendum</i> (which defines the commencement and the term of the
lease), the <i>reddendum</i> or reservation of rent, and the covenants
and conditions. The Conveyancing Act 1881 provides that,
as regards conveyances subsequent to 1881, unless a contrary
intention is expressed, a lease of &ldquo;land&rdquo; is to be deemed to
include all buildings, fixtures, easements, &amp;c., appertaining to it;
and, if there are houses or other buildings on the land demised,
all out-houses, erections, &amp;c., are to pass with the lease of the
land. Rights which the landlord desires to retain over the lands
let are excepted or reserved. Sporting rights will pass to the
lessee unless reserved (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Game Laws</a></span>). A grant or reservation
of mines in general terms confers, or reserves, a right to work
the mines, subject to the obligation of leaving a reasonable
support to the surface as it exists at the time of the grant or
reservation. It is not necessary that a lease should be dated.
In the absence of a date, it will take effect from the day of
delivery.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Covenants in Leases.</i>&mdash;These may be roughly divided into four
groups: (i.) <i>Implied Covenants.</i>&mdash;A covenant is said to be implied
when it is raised by implication of law without any express provision
being made for it in the lease. Thus a lessee is under an implied
obligation to treat the premises demised in a tenant-like or
&ldquo;husband-like&rdquo; manner, and again, where in a lease by deed the
word &ldquo;demise&rdquo; is used, the lessor probably covenants impliedly for
his own title and for the quiet enjoyment of the premises by the
lessee. (ii.) <i>&rdquo;Usual&rdquo; Covenants.</i>&mdash;Where an agreement for a lease
specifies only such essential conditions as the payment of rent, and
either mentions no other terms, or provides that the lease shall
contain the &ldquo;usual&rdquo; covenants, the parties are entitled to have
inserted in the lease made in pursuance of the agreement such other
provisions as are &ldquo;usual&rdquo; in leases of property of the same character,
and in the same district, not being provisions tending to abridge or
qualify the legal incidents of the estate intended to be granted to the
lessee. The question what covenants are &ldquo;usual&rdquo; is a question of
fact. A covenant by the lessor, limited to his own acts and those of
persons claiming under or through him, for the &ldquo;quiet enjoyment&rdquo;
by the lessee of the demised premises, and covenants by the lessee
to pay rent, to pay taxes, except such as fall upon the landlord, to
keep the premises in repair, and to allow the landlord to enter and
view the condition of the premises may be taken as typical instances
of &ldquo;usual&rdquo; covenants. Covenants by the lessee to build and repair,
not to assign or underlet without license, or to insure, or not to carry
on a particular trade on the premises leased, have been held not to be
&ldquo;usual.&rdquo; Where the agreement provides for the insertion in the
lease of &ldquo;proper&rdquo; covenants, such covenants only are pointed at as
are calculated to secure the full effect of the contract, and a covenant
against assignment or under-letting would not ordinarily be included.
(iii.) <i>The Covenants running with the Land.</i>&mdash;A covenant is said to
&ldquo;run with the land&rdquo; when the rights and duties which it creates are
not merely personal to the immediate parties (in which case a
covenant is said to be &ldquo;collateral&rdquo;), but pass also to their assignees.
At common law, it was said that covenants &ldquo;ran with the land&rdquo; but
not with the reversion, the assignee of the reversion not having the
rights of the original lessor. But the assignees of both parties were
placed on the same footing by a statute of Henry VIII. (1540). A
covenant &ldquo;runs with the land&rdquo; if it relates either to a thing <i>in esse</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>157</span>
which is part and parcel of the demise, <i>e.g.</i> the payment of rent, the
repair of houses or fixtures or machinery already built or set up, or
to a thing not <i>in esse</i> at the time of the demise, but touching the land,
provided that the word &ldquo;assigns&rdquo; is used in the covenant. All
implied covenants run with the land. As instances of &ldquo;collateral&rdquo;
covenants, we may take a covenant by a lessor to give the lessee a
right of pre-emption over a piece of land adjoining the subject of the
demise, or in the case of a lease of a beer-shop, not to keep any similar
shop within a prescribed distance from the premises demised, or a
covenant by a lessee to pay rates on premises not demised. A
covenant not to assign without the lessor&rsquo;s assent runs with the land
and applies to a re-assignment to the original lessee. (iv.) <i>Restrictive
Covenants.</i>&mdash;These may be subdivided into two classes&mdash;covenants
not to assign or underlet without the lessor&rsquo;s consent (it may be noted
that such consent must be applied for even if, under the covenant, it
cannot be withheld); and covenants in restraint of trade, <i>e.g.</i> not to
use the demised premises for certain trading purposes, and in the case
of &ldquo;tied houses&rdquo; a covenant by the lessees to purchase all beer
required from the lessors.</p>

<p>In addition a lease frequently contains covenants for renewal of the
lease at the option of the lessee, and for repairs or insurance against
damage by fire by the lessee. Leases frequently contain a covenant
by the lessee to bear and pay rates, taxes, assessments and other
&ldquo;impositions&rdquo; or &ldquo;charges,&rdquo; or &ldquo;duties&rdquo; or &ldquo;outgoings,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;burdens&rdquo; (except property tax) imposed upon the demised premises
during the term. Considerable difficulty has arisen as to the scope
of the terms &ldquo;impositions,&rdquo; &ldquo;charges,&rdquo; &ldquo;duties,&rdquo; &ldquo;outgoings,&rdquo;
&ldquo;burdens.&rdquo; The words, &ldquo;rates, taxes, assessments&rdquo; point to
payments of a periodical or recurring character. Are the latter
words in such covenants limited to payments of this kind, or do they
include single and definite payments demanded, for example, by a
local authority, acting under statutory powers, for improvements of
a permanent kind affecting the premises demised? The decisions on
the point are numerous and difficult to reconcile, but the main test
is whether, on the true construction of the particular covenant, the
lessee has undertaken to indemnify the landlord against payments of
all kinds. The stronger current of modern authority is in favour of
the landlords and not in favour of restricting the meaning of covenants
of this class. It may be added that, if a lessee covenants to
pay rates and taxes, no demand by the collector apparently is
necessary to constitute a breach of the covenant; where a rate is
duly made and published it is the duty of the parties assessed to seek
out the collector and pay it.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Mutual Rights and Liabilities of Landlord and Tenant.</i>&mdash;These
are to a large extent regulated by the covenants of the lease.
(i.) The landlord generally covenants&mdash;and, in the absence of
such a proviso, a covenant will be implied from the fact of letting&mdash;that
the tenant shall have quiet enjoyment of the premises
for the time agreed upon. This obligation makes the landlord
responsible for any lawful eviction of the tenant during the term,
but not for wrongful eviction unless he is himself the wrong-doer
or has expressly made himself responsible for evictions of
all kinds. It may be noted here that at common law no lease
for years is complete till actual entry has been made by the
lessee. Till then, he has only a right of entry or <i>interesse
termini</i>. (ii.) The tenant, on his part, is presumed to undertake
to use the property in a reasonable manner, according to
the purposes for which it was let, and to do reasonable repairs.
<span class="sidenote">Repairs.</span>
A landlord is not presumed to have undertaken to
put the premises in repair, nor to execute repairs.
But the respective obligations of parties where repairs are, as
they always are in leases for years, the subject of express covenant,
may vary indefinitely. The obligation is generally imposed
upon the tenant to keep the premises in &ldquo;good condition&rdquo;
or &ldquo;tenantable repair.&rdquo; The amount and quality of the repairs
necessary to fulfil the covenant are always relative to the age,
class and condition of the premises at the time of the lease. A
tenant is not responsible, under such a covenant, for deterioration
due to diminution in value caused by lapse of time or by the
elements. Where there is an unqualified covenant to repair,
and the premises during the tenancy are burnt down, or destroyed
by some other inevitable calamity, the tenant is bound to rebuild
and restore them at his own expense, even although the landlord
has taken out a policy on his own account and been paid by the
insurance company in respect of it. A covenant to keep in repair
requires the tenant to put the premises in repair if they are out
of it, and to maintain them in that condition up to and at the
end of the tenancy. A breach of the covenant to repair gives
the landlord an action for damages which will be measured by
the estimated injury to the reversion if the action be brought
during the tenancy, and by the sum necessary to execute the
repairs, if the action be brought later. (iii.) The improper user
of the premises to the injury of the reversioner is <i>waste</i> (<i>q.v.</i>).
(iv.) Covenants by the tenants to insure the premises and keep
them insured are also common; and if the premises are left
uninsured for the smallest portion of the term, though there is
no damage by fire, the covenant is broken. (v.) Covenants to
bear and pay rates and taxes have been discussed above. (vi.)
As to the tenant&rsquo;s obligation to pay rent, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rent</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Assignment, Attornment, Estoppel.</i>&mdash;The relationship of landlord
and tenant may be altered either voluntarily, by the act
of the parties, or involuntarily, by the operation of law, and
may also be dissolved. The principal mode of voluntary alteration
is an assignment either by the tenant of his term or by the
landlord of his reversion. An assignment which creates the
relationship of landlord and tenant between the lessor or lessee
and the assignee, must be by deed, but the acceptance by a
landlord of rent from a tenant under an invalid assignment
may create an implied tenancy from year to year; and similarly
payment of rent by a tenant may amount to an acknowledgment
of his landlord&rsquo;s title. This is one form of tenancy by estoppel.
The principle of all tenancies of this kind is that something has
been done by the party estopped, amounting to an admission
which he cannot be allowed to contradict. &ldquo;Attornment,&rdquo;
or the agreement by a tenant to become tenant to a new landlord,
is a term now often used to indicate an acknowledgment of
the existence of the relationship of landlord and tenant. It
may be noted that it is still common to insert in mortgage deeds
what is called an &ldquo;attornment clause,&rdquo; by which the mortgagor
&ldquo;attorns&rdquo; tenant to the mortgagee, and the latter thereupon
acquires a power of distress as an additional security. If the
lands assigned are situated in Middlesex or Yorkshire, the assignment
should be registered under the Middlesex Registry or
Yorkshire Registries Acts, as the case may be; and similar
provision is now made for the registration by an assignee of his
title under the Land Transfer Acts 1875 and 1897.</p>

<p><i>Underlease.</i>&mdash;Another form of alteration in a contract of
tenancy is an under-lease, which differs from assignment in this&mdash;that
the lessor parts with a portion of his estate instead of, as in
assignment, with the whole of it. There is no privity of contract
between an underlessee and the superior landlord, but the
latter can enforce against the former restrictive covenants of
which he had notice; it is the duty of the underlessee to inform
himself as to the covenants of the original lease, and, if he
enters and takes possession, he will be considered to have had
full notice of, and will be bound by, these covenants.</p>

<p><i>Bankruptcy, Death.</i>&mdash;The contract of tenancy may also be
altered by operation of law. If a tenant become bankrupt,
his interest passes to his trustee in bankruptcy&mdash;unless, as is
frequently the case, the lease makes the occurrence of that
contingency determine the lease. So, on the death of a tenant,
his interest passes to his legal representatives.</p>

<p><i>Dissolution of Tenancy.</i>&mdash;Tenancy is dissolved by the expiry
of the term for which it was created, or by forfeiture of the tenant&rsquo;s
interest on the ground of the breach of some condition by the
tenant and re-entry by the landlord. A breach of condition
may, however, be waived by the landlord, and the legislature
has made provision for the relief of the tenant from the consequences
of such breaches in certain cases. Relief from forfeiture
and rights of re-entry are now regulated chiefly by the Conveyancing
Acts 1881 and 1882. Under these acts a right of re-entry
or forfeiture is not to be enforceable unless and until the
lessor has served on the lessee a written notice specifying the
breach of covenant or condition complained of, and requiring
him to remedy it or make compensation, and this demand has
not within a reasonable time been complied with; and when a
lessor is proceeding to enforce such a right the court may, if it
think fit, grant relief to the lessee. A forfeiture is also waived
if the landlord elects not to take advantage of it&mdash;and shows
his election either expressly or impliedly by some act, which
acknowledges the continuance of the tenancy, <i>e.g.</i> by the acceptance
of, or even by an absolute and unqualified demand for,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>158</span>
rent, which has accrued due since the forfeiture, by bringing
an action for such rent, or by distraining for rent whether due
before or after the forfeiture.</p>

<p>A tenancy may also be determined by merger, <i>i.e.</i> where a
greater and a less estate coincide and meet in one and the same
person, without any intermediate estate, as, for instance, when
a tenant for years obtains the fee simple. There may also be a
surrender, either voluntary or by operation of law, which will
determine a tenancy, as, for example, when a tenant is party
to some act, the validity of which he is legally estopped from
denying and which would not have been valid had the tenancy
continued to exist.</p>

<p>The land, on the expiration of the tenancy, becomes at common
law the absolute property of the landlord, no matter how it
may have been altered or improved during the occupation. In
certain cases, however, the law has discriminated between the
contending claims of landlord and tenant. (1) In respect of
<i>fixtures</i> (which may be shortly defined as movables so affixed
to the soil as to become part thereof), the tenant may sometimes
remove them, <i>e.g.</i> when they have been brought on the premises
for the purpose of being used in business (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fixtures</a></span>). (2)
In respect of <i>emblements</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the profits of sown land, a tenant
may be entitled to these whose term comes to an end by the
happening of an uncertain contingency (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Emblements</a></span>).
(3) A similar right is very generally recognized by custom in
tenants whose term expires in the ordinary way. The custom
of the district, in the absence of stipulations between the parties,
would be imported into their contract&mdash;the tenant going out
on the same conditions as he came in. Such customary tenant
right only arises at the expiration of the lease, and on the substantial
performance of the covenants; and is forfeited if the
tenant abandons his tenancy during the term. Tenant right is
assignable, and will pass under an assignment of &ldquo;all the estate
and interest&rdquo; of the outgoing tenant in the farm. But, with
the exceptions noted, the land in its improved condition passes
over at common law to the landlord. The tenant may have
added to its value by buildings, by labour applied to the land,
or by the use of fertilizing manures, but, whatever be the amount
of the additional value, he is not entitled to any compensation
whatever. This again is a matter which the parties may, if
they please, regulate for themselves.</p>

<p>The law as to <i>Ejectment</i> is dealt with under that heading.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Statutory Provisions.</i>&mdash;Reference may be made, in conclusion, to
a few modern statutes which have affected the law of landlord and
tenant. The Agricultural Holdings Act 1908 (which repeals the
Agricultural Holdings Acts of 1883, 1900 and 1906) gives to the agricultural
tenant a right to compensation for (i.) certain specified
improvements made by him with the landlord&rsquo;s previous consent in
writing; and (ii.) certain other classes of improvements although the
landlord&rsquo;s consent has not been obtained. As examples of class (i.)
may be mentioned&mdash;erection or enlargement of buildings, laying
down of permanent pasture, making of gardens or fences, planting
of hops, embankments and sluices; as examples of (ii.)&mdash;chalking of
land, clay burning, application to land of purchased artificial or
purchased manure, except they have been made for the purpose of
making provision to protect the holding from injury or deterioration.
In the case of proposed drainage improvements, notice in writing
must be given to the landlord, who may then execute the improvements
himself and charge the tenant with interest not exceeding
5% per annum on the outlay, or such annual instalments, payable
for a period of twenty-five years, and recoverable as rent, as will
repay the outlay, with interest at the rate of 3% a year. Under s. 11
of the act a tenant is entitled to compensation for disturbance,
when he is compelled to quit without good and sufficient cause, and
for reasons inconsistent with good estate management. An agricultural
tenant may not contract himself out of his statutory right
to compensation, but &ldquo;contracting out&rdquo; is apparently not prohibited
with regard to the right given him by the acts of 1883 and
1900 to remove fixtures which he has erected and for which he is not
otherwise entitled to compensation, after reasonable notice to the
landlord, unless the latter elects to purchase such fixtures at a
valuation. The Agricultural Holdings Act 1906 conferred upon
every tenant (with slight exceptions) entire freedom of cropping and
of disposal of produce, notwithstanding any custom of the county
or explicit agreement to the contrary. (See further the articles
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ejectment</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fixtures</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rent</a></span>.) The Small Holdings and Allotments
Act 1908, which repealed previous acts of 1887, 1890 and 1907, deals,
on terms similar to those of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1908,
with small holdings and allotments (the expression &ldquo;small holding&rdquo;
meaning an agricultural holding which exceeds one acre, and
either does not exceed fifty acres, or, if exceeding fifty acres, is at
the date of sale or letting of an annual value for the purposes of
income tax not exceeding fifty pounds; the expression &ldquo;allotment&rdquo;
includes a field garden). Section 47 of the act gives the tenant the
same rights to compensation as if his holding had been a holding
under the Agricultural Holdings Act 1908 (<i>vide supra</i>). Compensation
was given to market gardeners for unexhausted improvements
by the Market Gardeners&rsquo; Compensation Act 1895 and by the
Agricultural Holdings Act 1906 for improvements effected before
the commencement of that act on a holding cultivated to the knowledge
of the landlord as a market garden, if the landlord had not
dissented in writing to the improvements. The important sections
of these acts were incorporated in the Agricultural Holdings Act
1908, s. 42.</p>

<p><i>Scots Law.</i>&mdash;The original lease in Scots law took the form of
a grant by the proprietor or lessor. But, with advancing civilization
and the consequent increase in the number of the conditions
to be imposed on both parties, leases became mutual contracts,
bilateral in form. The law of Scotland as to landlord and tenant
may be considered under two main heads:&mdash;I. <i>Ordinary Leases,
Common Law and Statutory</i>; II. <i>Building or Long Leases</i>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>I. <i>Ordinary Leases, Common Law and Statutory.</i>&mdash;A verbal lease
for a year is good. Such a lease for more than a year is not effectual
even for a year, except where the lessee has taken possession. At
common law, while a lease was binding on the grantor and his heirs,
it was not good against &ldquo;singular successors,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> persons acquiring
by purchase or adjudication, and the lessee was liable to be ejected
by such persons, unless (a precaution usually taken) sasine of the
subjects demised was expressly conferred on him by the lease. To
obviate this difficulty, the Scots Act 1449, c. 18, made possession of
the subjects of the lease equivalent to sasine. This enactment
applies to leases of agricultural subjects, houses, mills, fisheries and
whatever is <i>fundo annexum</i>; provided that (<i>a</i>) the lease, when for
more than one year, must be in writing, (<i>b</i>) it must be definite as to
subject, rent (which may consist of money, grain or services, if the
<i>reddendum</i> is not illusory) and term of duration, (<i>c</i>) possession must
follow on the lease. Special powers of granting leases are conferred
by statute on trustees. (Trusts [Scotland] Act 1867, s. 2), <i>curatores
bonis</i> (Judicial Factors [Scotland] Act 1889) and heirs of entail (cf.
Entail Act 1882, ss. 5, 6, 8, 9). The requisites of the statutory leases,
last mentioned, are similar to those imposed in England upon tenants
for life by the Settled Land Acts (<i>v. sup.</i> p. 3). The rent stipulated
for must not be illusory, and must fairly represent the value of the
subjects leased, and the term of the lease must not be excessive
(as to rent generally, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rent</a></span>). A life-renter can only grant a lease
that is effectual during the subsistence of the life-rent. There is
practically no limitation, but the will of the parties, as to the persons
to whom a lease may be granted. A lease granted to a tenant by
name will pass, on his death during the subsistence of the term to his
heir-at-law, even if the lease contains no destination to heirs. The
rights and obligations of the lessor and the tenant (<i>e.g.</i> as to the use
of the produce, the payment of rent, the quiet possession of the
subjects demised, and as to the payment of rates and taxes) are
similar to those existing under English law. An agricultural lease
does not, apart from stipulation, confer any right to kill game, other
than hares and rabbits (as to which, see the Ground Game Act 1880,
and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Game Laws</a></span>) or any right of fishing. A tenant is not entitled,
without the landlord&rsquo;s consent, to change the character of the
subjects demised, and, except under an agricultural lease, he is
bound to quit the premises on the expiration of the lease. In the case
of urban leases, however, ejectment (<i>q.v.</i>)&mdash;called in Scots Law
&ldquo;removing&rdquo;&mdash;will not be authorized unless the tenant received
40 days&rsquo; warning before the term of removal. In the absence of such
notice, the parties are held, if there be nothing in their conduct or in
the lease inconsistent with this presumption, to renew their agreement
in all its terms, and so on from year to year till due notice is
given. This is called &ldquo;tacit relocation.&rdquo; A lease may be transmitted
(i.) by &ldquo;assignation,&rdquo; intimated to the landlord, and followed
by possession on the part of the assignee; (ii.) by sub-lease&mdash;the
effect of which is equivalent to that of under-lease in English law;
(iii.) by succession, as of the heir of a tenant; (iv.) in the case of
agricultural holdings, by bequest (Agricultural Holdings [Scotland]
Act 1883, s. 29). A lease terminates (i.) by the expiration of its term
or by advantage being taken by the party in whose favour it is
stipulated, of a &ldquo;break&rdquo; in the term; (ii.) by the occurrence of an
&ldquo;irritancy&rdquo; of ground of forfeiture, either conventional, or statutory,
<i>e.g.</i> where a tenant&rsquo;s rent is in arrear, or he fails to remove on the
expiry of his lease (Act of Sederunt, 14th of Dec. 1756: Agricultural
Holdings Act 1883, s. 27); (iii.) by the bankruptcy or insolvency of
the tenant, at the landlord&rsquo;s option, if it is so stipulated in the lease;
(iv.) by the destruction, <i>e.g.</i> by fire, of the subject leased, unless the
landlord is bound to restore it. Complete destruction of the subject
leased, <i>e.g.</i> where a house is burnt down, or a farm is reduced to
&ldquo;sterility&rdquo; by flood or hurricane, discharges the tenant from the
obligation to pay rent. The effect of partial destruction has given
rise to some uncertainty. &ldquo;The distinction seems to be that if the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>159</span>
destruction be permanent, though partial, the failure of the subject
let will give relief by entitling the tenant to renounce the lease, unless
a deduction shall be allowed, but that if it be merely temporary or
occasional, it will not entitle the tenant to relief&rdquo; (Bell&rsquo;s <i>Prin.</i>
s. 1208). Agricultural leases usually contain special provisions as
to the order of cropping, the proper stocking of the farm, and the
rights of the incoming and outgoing tenant with regard to the waygoing
crop. Where the rent is in money, it is generally payable at
Whitsunday and Martinmas&mdash;the two &ldquo;legal terms.&rdquo; Sometimes
the term of payment is <i>before</i> the crop is reaped, sometimes <i>after</i>.
&ldquo;The terms thus stipulated are called &lsquo;the conventional terms&rsquo;;
the rent payable by anticipation being called &lsquo;forehand rent,&rsquo; that
which is payable after the crop is reaped, &lsquo;back rent.&rsquo; Where the
rent is in grain, or otherwise payable in produce, it is to be satisfied
from the produce of the farm, if there be any. If there be none the
tenant is bound and entitled to deliver fair marketable grain of the
same kind.&rdquo; (Bell&rsquo;s <i>Principles</i>, ss. 1204, 1205). The general rule
with regard to &ldquo;waygoing crops&rdquo; on arable farms is that the tenant
is entitled to reap the crop sown before the term of removal (whether
or not that be the natural termination of the lease), the right of
exclusive possession being his during seed time. But he is not entitled
to the use of the barns in threshing, &amp;c., the corn.</p>

<p>The Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Acts 1883 and 1900, already
referred to incidentally, contain provisions&mdash;similar to those of the
English acts&mdash;as to a tenant&rsquo;s right to compensation for unexhausted
improvements, removal for non-payment of rent, notice to quit at
the termination of a tenancy, and a tenant&rsquo;s property in fixtures.
The Crofters&rsquo; Holdings (Scotland) Acts 1886, 1887 and 1888, confer
on &ldquo;crofters&rdquo; special rights. A crofter is defined as &ldquo;a tenant of a
holding&rdquo;&mdash;being arable or pasture land, or partly arable and partly
pasture land&mdash;&ldquo;from year to year who resides on his holding, the
annual rent of which does not exceed £30 in money, and which is
situated in a &lsquo;crofting parish.&rsquo;&rdquo; Nearly all the parishes in Argyll,
Inverness, Ross, Cromarty, Sutherland, Caithness and Orkney and
Shetland answer to this description. The crofter enjoys a perpetual
tenure subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions as to payment
of rent, non-assignment of tenancy, &amp;c., and to defeasance at his
own option on giving one year&rsquo;s notice to the landlord. A Crofters&rsquo;
Commission constituted under the acts has power to fix fair rents,
and the crofter on renunciation of his tenancy or removal from his
holding is entitled to compensation for permanent improvements.
The Small Holdings Act 1892 applies to Scotland.</p>

<p>Under the law of Scotland down to 1880, a landlord had as security
for rent due on an agricultural lease a &ldquo;hypothec&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> a preferential
right over ordinary creditors, and extending, subject to certain
limitations, over the whole stock and crop of the tenant. This right
was enforceable by sequestration and sale. It was abolished in 1880
as regards all leases entered into after the 11th of November 1881,
where the land demised exceeded two acres in extent, and the landlord
was left to remedies akin to ejectment (Hypothec Abolition,
Scotland, Act 1880).</p>

<p>II. <i>Building or Long Leases.</i>&mdash;Under these leases, the term of which
is usually 99 and sometimes 999 years, the tenant is to a certain
extent in the position of a fee simple proprietor, except that his right
is terminable, and that he can only exercise such rights of ownership
as are conferred on him either by statute or by the terms of his lease.
Extensive powers of entering into such leases have been given by
statute to trustees subject to the authority of the Court (Trusts
[Scotland] Act 1867, s. 3) and to heirs of entail (Entail Acts 1840,
1849, 1882). Where long leases are &ldquo;probative,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> holograph or
duly tested, do not exceed 31 years, or, except as regards leases of
mines and minerals, and of lands held by burgage tenure, relate to
an extent of land exceeding 50 acres, and contain provisions for
renewal, they may be recorded for publication in the <i>Register of
Sasines</i>, and such publication has the effect of possession (Registration
of Leases [Scotland] Act 1857).</p>

<p><i>Ireland.</i>&mdash;The law of landlord and tenant was originally substantially
the same as that described for England is. But the modern
Land Acts have readjusted the relation between landlords and
tenants, while the Land Purchase Acts have aimed at abolishing those
relations by enabling the tenant to become the owner of his holding.
The way was paved for these changes by the existence in Ulster of a
local custom having virtually the force of law, which had two main
features&mdash;fixity of tenure, and free right of sale by the tenant of his
interest. These principles, with the addition of that of fair rents
settled by judicial means, were gradually established by the Land
Acts of 1870 and subsequent years, and the whole system was remodelled
by the Land Purchase Acts (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ireland</a></span>).</p>
</div>

<p><i>United States.</i>&mdash;The law of landlord and tenant in the United
States is in its principles similar to those of English law. It is
only possible to indicate, by way of example, some of the points
of similarity. The relationship of landlord and tenant is
created, altered and dissolved in the same way, and the rights
and duties of parties are substantially identical. A lease must
contain, either in itself or by clear reference, all the terms of a
complete contract&mdash;the names of the parties, description of the
property let, the rent (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rent</a></span>) and the conditions. The date
is not essential. That is a matter of identification as to time
only. In Pennsylvania, parol evidence of the date is allowed.
The general American doctrine is that where the contract is
contained in separate writings they must connect themselves by
reference, and that parol evidence is not admissible to connect
them. The English doctrine that a verbal lease may be specifically
enforced if there has been part performance by the person
seeking the remedy has been fully adopted in nearly all the
American states. The law as to the rights and obligations of
assignees and sub-lessees and as to surrender is the same as in
England. Forfeiture only renders a lease void as regards the
lessee; it may be waived by the lessor, and acceptance by the
landlord of rent due after forfeiture, with notice of such forfeiture,
amounts to waiver. Where there is a lease for a certain period,
no notice to quit is necessary. In uncertain tenancies there must
be reasonable notice&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> at common law six months generally.
The notice necessary to determine a monthly or weekly tenancy
is generally a month or a week (see further under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lodger</a></span>;
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lodgings</a></span>). In the United States, as in England, the covenant
for quiet enjoyment only extends, so far as relates to the acts
of third parties, to lawful acts of disturbance in the enjoyment
of the subject agreed to be let.</p>

<p><i>Laws of other Countries.</i>&mdash;It is impossible here to deal with the
systems of land tenure in force in other countries. Only the
question of the legal relations between landlord and tenant can
be touched upon. In France, the Code Civil recognizes two
such relationships, the letting to hire of houses (<i>bail à loyer</i>)
and the letting to farm of rural properties (<i>bail à ferme</i>). To a
certain extent, both forms of tenancy are governed by the same
rules. The letting may be either written or verbal. But a
verbal lease presents this disadvantage that, if it is unperformed
and one of the parties denies its existence, it cannot be proved
by witnesses. The party who denies the letting can only be put
to his oath (Arts. 1714-1715). It may further be noted that in
the case of a verbal lease, notice to quit is regulated by the
custom of the place (Art. 1736). The tenant or farmer has the
right of underletting or assigning his lease, in the absence of
prohibiting stipulation (Art. 1717). The lessor is bound by the
nature of his contract and without the need of any particular
stipulation (i.) to deliver to the lessee the thing hired in a good
state of repair; (ii.) to maintain it in a state to serve the purpose
for which it has been hired; (iii.) to secure to the lessee peaceable
enjoyment during the continuance of the lease (Arts. 1719-1720).
He is bound to warrant the lessee against, and to indemnify
him for, any loss arising from any faults or defects in the thing
hired which prevent its use, even though he was not aware
of them at the time of the lease (Art. 1721). If during the
continuance of the letting, the thing hired is entirely destroyed
by accident, the lease is cancelled. In case of partial destruction,
the lessee may, according to circumstances, demand either a
diminution of the price, or the cancellation of the lease. In
neither case is there ground for damages (Art. 1722). The
lessor cannot, during the lease, change the form of the thing
hired (Art. 1723). The lessee is bound, on his side (i.) to use
the thing hired like a good head of a household (<i>bon père de
famille</i>), in accordance with the express or presumed purpose
of the hiring; (ii.) to pay the price of the hiring at the times
agreed (Art. 1728). On breach of the former obligation, the
lease may be judicially cancelled (Art. 1729). As to the consequences
of breach of the latter, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rent</a></span>. If a statement of
the condition of the property (<i>état des lieux</i>) has been prepared,
the lessee must give it up such as he received it according to the
statement, except what has perished or decayed by age or by
means of <i>force majeure</i> (Art. 1730). In the absence of an <i>état
des lieux</i>, the lessee is presumed to have received the thing hired
in a good state of tenantable repair, and must so yield it up,
saving proof to the contrary (Art. 1731). He is liable for injuries
or losses happening during his enjoyment, unless he prove that
they have taken place without his fault (Art. 1732); in particular,
for loss by fire unless he show that the fire happened by accident,
<i>force majeure</i>, or defect of construction, or through communication
from a neighbouring house (Art. 1733). The lessee is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>160</span>
liable for injuries and losses happening by the act of persons
belonging to his house or of his sub-tenants (Art. 1735). A lease
terminates (i.) at the expiration of the prescribed term (Art.
1737)&mdash;if at that period the lessee remains and is left in possession,
there is, in the case of written leases, a tacit renewal (<i>tacite
reconduction</i>) of the lease as a verbal lease (Arts. 1738-1739);
(ii.) by the loss of the thing hired and by the default of the lessor
or lessee in the fulfilment of their respective obligations (Art.
1741), but (iii.) not by the death either of the lessor or of the
lessee (1742). The conditions of <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ejectment</a></span> are stated under
that heading. The special rules (Arts. 1752-1762) relative
to the hire of houses are touched upon in <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lodger and Lodgings</a></span>.
It only remains here to refer to those applicable to leases to
farm. The lessee is bound to stock the farm with the cattle
and implements necessary for its husbandry (Art. 1766), and to
stack in the places appointed for the purpose in the lease (Art.
1767). A lessee, who farms on condition of dividing the produce
with the lessor, can only underlet or assign if he is expressly
empowered to do so by the lease (Art. 1763). The lessee must
give notice to the lessor of any acts of usurpation committed
on the property (Art. 1768). If at least half of the harvest in
any year is destroyed by accident, the lessee (<i>a</i>) in the case of a
lease for several years, obtains, at the end of his lease, a refund
of rent, by way of indemnity, unless he has been indemnified
by preceding harvests; (<i>b</i>) in the case of a lease for a year only,
may secure a proportional abatement of the current rent. No
refund is payable if the produce was severed before the accident,
unless the lessor was entitled to a portion of it, when he must
bear his share of the loss, provided the lessee was not <i>in morâ</i>
as regards the delivery of the lessor&rsquo;s portion. The lessee has
no right to a refund when the cause of damage was existing
and known at the date of the lease (Arts. 1769-1771). Liability
for loss by &ldquo;accidents&rdquo; may be thrown on the lessee by express
stipulation (Art. 1772). &ldquo;Accidents&rdquo; here mean ordinary
accidents only, such as hail, lightning or frost, and the lessee
will not be answerable for loss caused by extraordinary accidents
such as war or floods, unless he has been made liable for all
accidents, foreseen or unforeseen (Art. 1773). A verbal lease
is deemed to be for the term necessary to enable the lessee to
gather in all the produce, thus for a year in the case of a meadow
or vineyard; in the case of lands leased in tillage, where they
are divided into shifts or seasons, for as many years as there are
shifts (Art. 1774). The outgoing must leave for the incoming
tenant convenient housing and other facilities for the labours
of the year following; the incoming must procure for the
outgoing tenant conveniences for the consumption of his fodder
and for the harvests remaining to be got in. In either case the
custom of the place is to be followed (Art. 1777). The outgoing
tenant must leave the straw and manure of the year, if he received
them at the beginning of his lease, and even where he has not
so received them, the owner may retain them according to
valuation (Art. 1778). A word must be added as to letting by
cheptel (<i>bail à cheptel</i>)&mdash;a contract by which one of the parties
gives to the other a stock of cattle to keep under conditions
agreed on between them (Art. 1800). There are several varieties
of the contract, (i.) simple cheptel (<i>cheptel simple</i>) in which the
whole stock is supplied by the lessor&mdash;the lessee taking half
the profit and bearing half the loss (Art. 1804); (ii.) cheptel
by moiety (<i>cheptel à moietié</i>)&mdash;here each of the contracting
parties furnishes half of the stock, which remains common for
profit or loss (Art. 1818); (iii.) cheptel given to a farmer (<i>fermier</i>)
or participating cultivator (<i>colon partiaire</i>)&mdash;in the cheptel
given to the farmer (also called <i>cheptel de fer</i>) stock of a value
equal to the estimated price of the stock given must be left at
the expiry of the lease (Art. 1821); cheptel given to the participating
cultivator resembles simple cheptel, except in points
of detail (Arts. 1827-1830); (iv.) the term &ldquo;cheptel&rdquo; is also
improperly applied to a contract by which cattle are given to be
housed and fed&mdash;here the lessor retains the ownership, but has
only the profit of the calves (Art. 1831).</p>

<p>The French system just described is in force in its entirety
in Belgium (Code Civil, Arts. 1713 et seq.) and has been followed
to some extent in Italy (Civil Code, Arts. 1568 et seq.), Spain
(Civil Code, Arts 1542 et seq.), and Portugal (Civil Code, Arts.
1298 et seq., 1595 et seq.). In all these countries there are
varieties of emphyteutic tenure; and in Italy the mezzadria
or metayer system (see Civil Code, Arts. 1647 et seq.) exists.
The German Civil Code adopts the distinction between <i>bail à loyer</i>
(Miehl, Arts. 535 et seq.) and <i>bail à ferme</i> (Pacht, Arts. 581
et seq.). Dutch law also (Civil Code, Arts. 1583 et seq.) is similar
to the French.</p>

<p>The Indian law of landlord and tenant is described in the
article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Indian Law</a></span>. The laws of the various British colonies
on the subject are too numerous and too different to be dealt
with here. In Mauritius, the provisions of the Code Civil are
in force without modification. In Quebec (Civil Code, Arts.
1605 et seq.) and St Lucia (Civil Code, Arts. 1512 et seq.) they
have been reproduced by the local law. In many of the colonies,
parts of the English law of landlord and tenant, common law
and statutory, have been introduced by local enactments (cf.
British Guiana, Ord. 4 of 1846; Jamaica, 1 Vict. c. 26). In
others (<i>e.g.</i> Victoria, Landlord and Tenant Act 1890, No. 1108;
Ontario, Rev. Stats. 1897, c. 170) consolidating statutes have
been passed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANDON, CHARLES PAUL<a name="ar53" id="ar53"></a></span> (1760-1826), French painter and
art-author, was born at Nonant in 1760. He entered the studio of
Regnault, and won the first prize of the Academy in 1792.
After his return from Italy, disturbed by the Revolution, he
seems to have abandoned painting for letters, but he began to
exhibit in 1795, and continued to do so at various intervals up
to 1814. His &ldquo;Leda&rdquo; obtained an award of merit in 1801, and is
now in the Louvre. His &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s Lesson,&rdquo; &ldquo;Paul and Virginia
Bathing,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Daedalus and Icarus&rdquo; have been engraved; but
his works on painting and painters, which reach nearly one
hundred volumes, form his chief title to be remembered. In
spite of a complete want of critical accuracy, an extreme carelessness
in the biographical details, and the feebleness of the line
engravings by which they are illustrated, Landon&rsquo;s <i>Annales
du Musée</i>, in 33 vols., form a vast repertory of compositions by
masters of every age and school of permanent value. Landon
also published <i>Lives of Celebrated Painters</i>, in 22 vols.; <i>An
Historical Description of Paris</i>, 2 vols.; a <i>Description of London</i>,
with 42 plates; and descriptions of the Luxembourg, of the
Giustiniani collection, and of the gallery of the duchesse de
Berry. He died at Paris in 1826.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANDON, LETITIA ELIZABETH<a name="ar54" id="ar54"></a></span> (1802-1838), English poet
and novelist, better known by her initials L. E. L. than as Miss
Landon or Mrs Maclean, was descended from an old Herefordshire
family, and was born at Chelsea on the 14th of August
1802. She went to a school in Chelsea where Miss Mitford also
received her education. Her father, an army agent, amassed a
large property, which he lost by speculation shortly before his
death. About 1815 the Landons made the acquaintance of
William Jerdan, and Letitia began her contributions to the
<i>Literary Gazette</i> and to various Christmas annuals. She also
published some volumes of verse, which soon won for her a wide
literary fame. The gentle melancholy and romantic sentiment
her writings embodied suited the taste of the period, and would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>161</span>
in any case have secured her the sympathy and approval of a
wide class of readers. She displays richness of fancy and aptness
of language, but her work suffered from hasty production, and
has not stood the test of time. The large sums she earned by her
literary labours were expended on the support of her family.
An engagement to John Forster, it is said, was broken off through
the intervention of scandalmongers. In June 1838 she married
George Maclean, governor of the Gold Coast, but she only survived
her marriage, which proved to be very unhappy, by a few
months. She died on the 15th of October 1838 at Cape Coast from
an overdose of prussic acid, which, it is supposed, was taken
accidentally.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>For some time L. E. L. was joint editor of the <i>Literary Gazette</i>.
Her first volume of poetry appeared in 1820 under the title The
<i>Fate of Adelaide</i>, and was followed by other collections of verses
with similar titles. She also wrote several novels, of which the best
is <i>Ethel Churchill</i> (1837). Various editions of her <i>Poetical Works</i>
have been published since her death, one in 1880 with an introductory
memoir by W. B. Scott. <i>The Life and Literary Remains of
Letilia Elizabeth Landon</i>, by Laman Blanchard, appeared in 1841,
and a second edition in 1855.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANDOR, WALTER SAVAGE<a name="ar55" id="ar55"></a></span> (1775-1864), English writer,
eldest son of Walter Landor and his wife Elizabeth Savage, was
born at Warwick on the 30th of January 1775. [He was sent to
Rugby school, but was removed at the headmaster&rsquo;s request
and studied privately with Mr Langley, vicar of Ashbourne.
In 1793 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge. He adopted
republican principles and in 1794 fired a gun at the windows of
a Tory for whom he had an aversion. He was rusticated for a
year, and, although the authorities were willing to condone the
offence, he refused to return. The affair led to a quarrel with
his father in which Landor expressed his intention of leaving
home for ever. He was, however, reconciled with his family
through the efforts of his friend Dorothea Lyttelton. He entered
no profession, but his father allowed him £150 a year, and he
was free to live at home or not as he pleased.]</p>

<p>In 1795 appeared in a small volume, divided into three books,
<i>The Poems of Walter Savage Landor</i>, and, in pamphlet form of
nineteen pages, an anonymous <i>Moral Epistle, respectfully
dedicated to Earl Stanhope</i>. No poet at the age of twenty ever
had more vigour of style and fluency of verse; nor perhaps has
any ever shown such masterly command of epigram and satire,
made vivid and vital by the purest enthusiasm and most generous
indignation. Three years later appeared the first edition of the
first great work which was to inscribe his name for ever among
the great names in English poetry. The second edition of <i>Gebir</i>
appeared in 1803, with a text corrected of grave errors and
improved by magnificent additions. About the same time the
whole poem was also published in a Latin form, which for
might and melody of line, for power and perfection of language,
must always dispute the palm of precedence with the English
version. [His father&rsquo;s death in 1805 put him in possession of an
independent fortune. Landor settled in Bath. Here in 1808
he met Southey, and the mutual appreciation of the two poets
led to a warm friendship.] In 1808, under an impulse not less
heroic than that which was afterwards to lead Byron to a
glorious death in redemption of Greece and his own good fame,
Landor, then aged thirty-three, left England for Spain as a
volunteer to serve in the national army against Napoleon at the
head of a regiment raised and supported at his sole expense.
After some three months&rsquo; campaigning came the affair of Cintra
and its disasters; &ldquo;his troop,&rdquo; in the words of his biographer,
&ldquo;dispersed or melted away, and he came back to England in as
great a hurry as he had left it,&rdquo; but bringing with him the
honourable recollection of a brave design unselfishly attempted,
and the material in his memory for the sublimest poem published
in our language, between the last masterpiece of Milton and the
first masterpiece of Shelley&mdash;one equally worthy to stand
unchallenged beside either for poetic perfection as well as moral
majesty&mdash;the lofty tragedy of <i>Count Julian</i>, which appeared in
1812, without the name of its author. No comparable work is
to be found in English poetry between the date of <i>Samson
Agonistes</i> and the date of <i>Prometheus Unbound</i>; and with both
these great works it has some points of greatness in common.
The superhuman isolation of agony and endurance which encircles
and exalts the hero is in each case expressed with equally
appropriate magnificence of effect. The style of <i>Count Julian</i>,
if somewhat deficient in dramatic ease and the fluency of natural
dialogue, has such might and purity and majesty of speech as
elsewhere we find only in Milton so long and so steadily sustained.</p>

<p>In May 1811 Landor had suddenly married Miss Julia Thuillier,
with whose looks he had fallen in love at first sight in a ball-room
at Bath; and in June they settled for a while at Llanthony Abbey
in Monmouthshire, from whence he was worried in three years&rsquo;
time by the combined vexation of neighbours and tenants,
lawyers and lords-lieutenant; not before much toil and money
had been nobly wasted on attempts to improve the sterility of
the land, to relieve the wretchedness and raise the condition of
the peasantry. He left England for France at first, but after
a brief residence at Tours took up his abode for three years at
Como; &ldquo;and three more wandering years he passed,&rdquo; says his
biographer, &ldquo;between Pisa and Pistoja, before he pitched his
tent in Florence in 1821.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1835 he had an unfortunate difference with his wife which
ended in a complete separation. In 1824 appeared the first
series of his <i>Imaginary Conversations</i>, in 1826 &ldquo;the second
edition, corrected and enlarged&rdquo;; a supplementary third volume
was added in 1828; and in 1829 the second series was given to
the world. Not until 1846 was a fresh instalment added, in the
second volume of his collected and selected works. During the
interval he had published his three other most famous and greatest
books in prose: <i>The Citation and Examination of William
Shakespeare</i> (1834), <i>Pericles and Aspasia</i> (1836), <i>The Pentameron</i>
(1837). To the last of these was originally appended <i>The
Pentalogia</i>, containing five of the very finest among his shorter
studies in dramatic poetry. In 1847 he published his most
important Latin work, <i>Poemata et inscriptiones</i>, comprising,
with large additions, the main contents of two former volumes
of idyllic, satiric, elegiac and lyric verse; and in the same golden
year of his poetic life appeared the very crown and flower of
its manifold labours, the <i>Hellenics of Waller Savage Landor</i>,
enlarged and completed. Twelve years later this book was
re-issued, with additions of more or less value, with alterations
generally to be regretted, and with omissions invariably to be
deplored. In 1853 he put forth <i>The Last Fruit off an Old Tree</i>,
containing fresh conversations, critical and controversial essays,
miscellaneous epigrams, lyrics and occasional poems of various
kind and merit, closing with <i>Five Scenes</i> on the martyrdom
of Beatrice Cenci, unsurpassed even by their author himself
for noble and heroic pathos, for subtle and genial, tragic and
profound, ardent and compassionate insight into character,
with consummate mastery of dramatic and spiritual truth.
In 1856 he published <i>Antony and Octavius&mdash;Scenes for the
Study</i>, twelve consecutive poems in dialogue which alone would
suffice to place him high among the few great masters of historic
drama.</p>

<p>In 1858 appeared a metrical miscellany bearing the title of
<i>Dry Sticks Fagoted by W. S. Landor</i>, and containing among
other things graver and lighter certain epigrammatic and satirical
attacks which reinvolved him in the troubles of an action for
libel; and in July of the same year he returned for the last
six years of his life to Italy, which he had left for England in
1835. [He was advised to make over his property to his family,
on whom he was now dependent. They appear to have refused
to make him an allowance unless he returned to England. By
the exertions of Robert Browning an allowance was secured.
Browning settled him first at Siena and then at Florence.]
Embittered and distracted by domestic dissensions, if brightened
and relieved by the affection and veneration of friends and
strangers, this final period of his troubled and splendid career
came at last to a quiet end on the 17th of September 1864. In
the preceding year he had published a last volume of <i>Heroic
Idyls, with Additional Poems</i>, English and Latin,&mdash;the better
part of them well worthy to be indeed the &ldquo;last fruit&rdquo; of a
genius which after a life of eighty-eight years had lost nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>162</span>
of its majestic and pathetic power, its exquisite and exalted
loveliness.</p>

<p>A complete list of Landor&rsquo;s writings, published or privately
printed, in English, Latin and Italian, including pamphlets,
fly-sheets and occasional newspaper correspondence on political
or literary questions, it would be difficult to give anywhere and
impossible to give here. From nineteen almost to ninety his
intellectual and literary activity was indefatigably incessant;
but, herein at least like Charles Lamb, whose cordial admiration
he so cordially returned, he could not write a note of three lines
which did not bear the mark of his &ldquo;Roman hand&rdquo; in its
matchless and inimitable command of a style at once the most
powerful and the purest of his age. The one charge which can
ever seriously be brought and maintained against it is that of
such occasional obscurity or difficulty as may arise from excessive
strictness in condensation of phrase and expurgation of matter
not always superfluous, and sometimes almost indispensable.
His English prose and his Latin verse are perhaps more frequently
and more gravely liable to this charge than either his English
verse or his Latin prose. At times it is well-nigh impossible for
an eye less keen and swift, a scholarship less exquisite and ready
than his own, to catch the precise direction and follow the perfect
course of his rapid thought and radiant utterance. This apparently
studious pursuit and preference of the most terse and elliptic
expression which could be found for anything he might have to
say could not but occasionally make even so sovereign a master
of two great languages appear &ldquo;dark with excess of light&rdquo;;
but from no former master of either tongue in prose or verse
was ever the quality of real obscurity, of loose and nebulous
incertitude, more utterly alien or more naturally remote. There
is nothing of cloud or fog about the path on which he leads us;
but we feel now and then the want of a bridge or a handrail;
we have to leap from point to point of narrative or argument
without the usual help of a connecting plank. Even in his
dramatic works, where least of all it should have been found,
this lack of visible connexion or sequence in details of thought
or action is too often a source of sensible perplexity. In his
noble trilogy on the history of Giovanna queen of Naples it is
sometimes actually difficult to realize on a first reading what
has happened or is happening, or how, or why, or by what
agency&mdash;a defect alone sufficient, but unhappily sufficient in
itself, to explain the too general ignorance of a work so rich in
subtle and noble treatment of character, so sure and strong in
its grasp and rendering of &ldquo;high actions and high passions,&rdquo;
so rich in humour and in pathos, so royally serene in its commanding
power upon the tragic mainsprings of terror and of pity.
As a poet, he may be said on the whole to stand midway between
Byron and Shelley&mdash;about as far above the former as below the
latter. If we except Catullus and Simonides, it might be hard
to match and it would be impossible to overmatch the flawless
and blameless yet living and breathing beauty of his most perfect
elegies, epigrams or epitaphs. As truly as prettily was he
likened by Leigh Hunt &ldquo;to a stormy mountain pine which
should produce lilies.&rdquo; His passionate compassion, his bitter
and burning pity for all wrongs endured in all the world, found
only their natural and inevitable outlet in his lifelong defence
or advocacy of tyrannicide as the last resource of baffled justice,
the last discharge of heroic duty. His tender and ardent love
of children, of animals and of flowers makes fragrant alike
the pages of his writing and the records of his life. He was as
surely the most gentle and generous as the most headstrong and
hot-headed of heroes or of men. Nor ever was any man&rsquo;s best
work more thoroughly imbued and informed with evidence of
his noblest qualities. His loyalty and liberality of heart were
as inexhaustible as his bounty and beneficence of hand. Praise
and encouragement, deserved or undeserved, came yet more
readily to his lips than challenge or defiance. Reviled and
ridiculed by Lord Byron, he retorted on the offender living less
readily and less warmly than he lamented and extolled him dead.
On the noble dramatic works of his brother Robert he lavished
a magnificence of sympathetic praise which his utmost self-estimate
would never have exacted for his own. Age and the
lapse of time could neither heighten nor lessen the fulness of
this rich and ready generosity. To the poets of his own and
of the next generation he was not readier to do honour than to
those of a later growth, and not seldom of deserts far lower and
far lesser claims than theirs. That he was not unconscious of
his own, and avowed it with the frank simplicity of nobler
times, is not more evident or more certain than that in comparison
with his friends and fellows he was liable rather to
undervalue than to overrate himself. He was a classic, and no
formalist; the wide range of his just and loyal admiration had
room for a genius so far from classical as Blake&rsquo;s. Nor in his
own highest mood or method of creative as of critical work was
he a classic only, in any narrow or exclusive sense of the term.
On either side, immediately or hardly below his mighty masterpiece
of <i>Pericles and Aspasia</i>, stand the two scarcely less beautiful
and vivid studies of medieval Italy and Shakespearean England.
The very finest flower of his immortal dialogues is probably to
be found in the single volume comprising only &ldquo;Imaginary
Conversations of Greeks and Romans&rdquo;; his utmost command
of passion and pathos may be tested by its transcendent
success in the distilled and concentrated tragedy of <i>Tiberius
and Vipsania</i>, where for once he shows a quality more proper
to romantic than classical imagination&mdash;the subtle and sublime
and terrible power to enter the dark vestibule of distraction,
to throw the whole force of his fancy, the whole fire of his
spirit, into the &ldquo;shadowing passion&rdquo; (as Shakespeare calls it)
of gradually imminent insanity. Yet, if this and all other
studies from ancient history or legend could be subtracted from
the volume of his work, enough would be left whereon to rest
the foundation of a fame which time could not sensibly impair.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAND REGISTRATION,<a name="ar57" id="ar57"></a></span> a legal process connected with the
transfer of landed property, comprising two forms&mdash;registration
of deeds and registration of title, which may be best described
as a species of machinery for assisting a purchaser or mortgagee
in his inquiries as to his vendor&rsquo;s or mortgagor&rsquo;s title previously
to completing his dealing, and for securing his own position
afterwards. The expediency of making inquiry into the vendor&rsquo;s
title before completing a purchase of land (and the case of a
mortgage is precisely similar) is obvious. In the case of goods
possession may ordinarily be relied on as proof of full ownership;
in the case of land, the person in ostensible possession is very
seldom the owner, being usually only a tenant, paying rent to
someone else. Even the person to whom the rent is paid is
in many cases&mdash;probably, in England, in most cases&mdash;not the
full owner, but only a life owner, or a trustee, whose powers of
disposing of the property are of a strictly limited nature. Again,
goods are very seldom the subject of a mortgage, whereas land
has from time immemorial been the frequent subject of this
class of transaction. Evidently, therefore, some sort of inquiry
is necessary to enable a purchaser to obtain certainty that the
land for which he pays full price is not subject to an unknown
mortgage or charge which, if left undiscovered, might afterwards
deprive him of a large part or even the whole of its value. Again,
the probability of serious consequences to the purchaser ensuing
from a mistake as to title is infinitely greater in the case of land
than in the case of goods. Before the rightful owner can recover
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>163</span>
misappropriated goods, he has to find out where they are. This
is usually a matter of considerable difficulty. By the time they
have reached the hands of a <i>bonâ fide</i> purchaser all chance of
their recovery by the true owner is practically at an end. But
with land the case is far otherwise. A dispossessed rightful
owner never has any difficulty in tracing his property, for it
is immovable. All he has to do is to bring an action for ejectment
against the person in possession. For these reasons, among others,
any attempt to deal with land on the simple and unsuspecting
principles which obtain in regard to goods would be fraught
with grave risks.</p>

<p>Apart from very early and primitive social conditions, there
appear to be only two ways in which the required certainty as
to title to land can be obtained. Either the purchaser must
satisfy himself, by an exhaustive scrutiny and review of all the
deeds, wills, marriages, heirships and other documents and events
by which the property has been conveyed, mortgaged, leased,
devised or transmitted during a considerable period of time,
that no loophole exists whereby an adverse claim can enter or
be made good&mdash;this is called the system of private investigation
of title&mdash;or the government must keep an authoritative list
or register of the properties within its jurisdiction, together
with the names of the owners and particulars of the encumbrances
in each case, and must protect purchasers and others dealing
with land, on the faith of this register, from all adverse claims.
This second system is called Registration of Title. To these
two alternatives may perhaps be added a third, of very recent
growth&mdash;Insurance of Title. This is largely used in the United
States. But it is in reality only a phase of the system of private
investigation. The insurance company investigates the title,
and charges the purchaser a premium to cover the expense and
the risk of error. Registration of deeds is an adjunct of the
system of private investigation, and, except in England, is a
practically invariable feature of it. It consists in the establishment
of public offices in which all documents affecting land are
to be recorded&mdash;partly to preserve them in a readily accessible
place, partly to prevent the possibility of any material deed
or document being dishonestly concealed by a vendor. Where
registration is effected by depositing a full copy of the deed, it
also renders the subsequent falsification of the original document
dangerous. Registration of deeds does not (except perhaps to
a certain extent indirectly) cheapen or simplify the process of
investigation&mdash;the formalities at the registry add something
to the trouble and cost incurred&mdash;but it prevents the particular
classes of fraud mentioned.</p>

<p>The history of land registration follows, as a general rule, a
fairly uniform course of development. In very early times, and
in small and simple communities, the difficulty afterwards found
in establishing title to land does not arise, owing to the primitive
habit of attaching ceremony and publicity to all dealings. The
parties meet on the land, with witnesses; symbolical acts (such
as handing over a piece of earth, or the bough of a tree) are
performed; and a set form of words is spoken, expressive of
the intention to convey. By this means the ownership of each
estate in the community becomes to a certain extent a matter
of common knowledge, rendering fraud and mistake difficult.
But this method leaves a good deal to be desired in point of
security. Witnesses die, and memory is uncertain; and one of
the earliest improvements consists in the establishment of a sort
of public record kept by the magistrate, lord or other local
authority, containing a series of contemporary notes of the
effect of the various transactions that take place. This book
becomes the general title-deed of the whole community, and as
long as transactions remain simple, and not too numerous,
the results appear to be satisfactory. Of this character are the
Manorial Court Rolls, which were in the middle ages the great
authorities on title, both in England and on the continent.
The entries in them in early times were made in a very few words.
The date, the names of the parties, the name or short verbal
description of the land, the nature of the transaction, are all that
appear. In the land registry at Vienna there is a continuous
series of registers of this kind going back to 1368, in Prague
to 1377, in Munich to 1440. No doubt there are extant (though
in a less easily accessible form) manorial records in England of
equal or greater antiquity. This may be considered the first
stage in the history of Land Registration. It can hardly be said
to be in active operation at the present day in any civilized
country&mdash;in the sense in which that term is usually understood.
Where dealings become more numerous and complicated,
written instruments are required to express the intentions of the
parties, and afterwards to supply evidence of the landowner&rsquo;s
title. It appears, too, that as a general rule the public books
already described continue to be used, notwithstanding this
change; only (as would be expected) the entries in them, once
plain and simple, either grow into full copies of the long and
intricate deeds, or consist of mere notes stating that such and
such deeds have been executed, leaving the persons interested
to inquire for the originals, in whose custody soever they may
be found. This system, which may be regarded as the second
stage in the history of land registration, is called Registration
of Deeds. It prevails in France, Belgium, parts of Switzerland,
in Italy, Spain, India, in almost all the British colonies (except
Australasia and Canada), in most of the states of the American
Union, in the South American republics, in Scotland and Ireland,
and in the English counties of Yorkshire and Middlesex. Where
it exists, there is generally a law to the effect that in case of
dispute a registered deed shall prevail over an unregistered one.
The practical effect is that a purchaser can, by searching the
register, find out exactly what deeds he ought to inquire for,
and receives an assurance that if, after completion, he registers
his own conveyance, no other deeds&mdash;even if they exist&mdash;will
prevail against him.</p>

<p>The expenses and delays, not to mention the occasional actual
losses of property through fraud or mistake, attendant on the
system of making every purchaser responsible for the due
examination of his vendor&rsquo;s title&mdash;whether or not assisted by
registration of deeds&mdash;have induced several governments to
establish the more perfect system of Registration of Title, which
consists in collecting the transactions affecting each separate
estate under a separate head, keeping an accurate account of the
parcels of which each such estate is composed, and summarizing
authoritatively, as each fresh transaction occurs, the subsisting
rights of all parties in relation to the land itself. This system
prevails in Germany, Austria, Hungary, parts of Switzerland,
the Australasian colonies, nearly the whole of Canada, some of
the states of the American Union, to a certain extent in Ireland,
and is in course of establishment in England and Wales. The
Register consists of three portions:&mdash;(1) The description of the
land, usually, but not necessarily, accompanied by a reference
to a map; (2) the ownership, giving the name and address of
the person who can sell and dispose of the land; and (3) the
encumbrances, in their order of priority, and the names of the
persons for the time being entitled to them. When any fresh
transaction takes place the instrument effecting it is produced,
and the proper alterations in, or additions to, the register are
made: if it be a sale, the name of the vendor is cancelled from
the register, and that of the purchaser is entered instead; if
it be a mortgage, it is added to the list of encumbrances; if a
discharge, the encumbrance discharged is cancelled; if it is a
sale of part of the land, the original description is modified or the
plan is marked to show the piece conveyed, while a new description
or plan is made and a new register is opened for the detached
parcel. In the English and Australian registries a &ldquo;land
certificate&rdquo; is also issued to the landowner containing copies
of the register and of the plan. This certificate takes the place
more or less of the old documents of title. On a sale, the process
is as follows: The vendor first of all produces to the purchaser
his land certificate, or gives him the number of his title and an
authority to inspect the register. In Austria and in some colonial
registries this is not necessary, the register being open to public
inspection, which in England is not the case. The purchaser, on
inspecting this, can easily see for himself whether the land he
wishes to buy is comprised in the registered description or plan,
whether the vendor&rsquo;s name appears on the register as the owner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>164</span>
of the land, and whether there are any encumbrances or other
burdens registered as affecting it. If there are encumbrances,
the register states their amount and who are entitled to them.
The purchaser then usually<a name="fa1c" id="fa1c" href="#ft1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a> prepares a conveyance or transfer
of the land (generally in a short printed form issued by the
registry), and the vendor executes it in exchange for the purchase
money. If there are mortgages, he pays them off to the persons
named in the register as their owners, and they concur in a
discharge. He then presents the executed instruments at the
registry, and is entered as owner of the land instead of the vendor,
the mortgages, if any, being cancelled. Where &ldquo;land certificates&rdquo;
are used (as in England and Australia), a new land certificate is
issued to the purchaser showing the existing state of the register
and containing a copy of the registered plan of the land. The
above is only a brief outline of the processes employed. For
further information as to practical details reference may be
made to the treatises mentioned at the end of this article.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>England and Wales.</i>&mdash;The first attempt to introduce general registration
of conveyances appears to have been made by the Statute of
Enrolments, passed in the 27th year of Henry VIII. But this was
soon found to be capable of evasion, and it became a dead letter.
A Registration Act applying to the counties of Lancaster, Chester
and Durham was passed in Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, but failed for
want of providing the necessary machinery for its observance.
The subject reappeared in several bills during the Commonwealth,
but these failed to pass, owing, it would seem, to the objection of
landowners to publicity. In 1669 a committee of the House of Lords
reported that one cause of the depreciation of landed property was
the uncertainty of titles, and proposed registration of deeds as a
remedy, but nothing was done.</p>

<p>During the next thirty years numerous pamphlets for and against
a general registry were published. In 1704 the first Deed Registry
Act was passed, applying to the West Riding of Yorkshire. In 1707
the system was extended to the East Riding, and in 1708 to Middlesex.
These Middlesex and Yorkshire registries (modified considerably in
practice, but not seriously in principle, by the Yorkshire Registries
Acts 1884, 1885, and Land Registry [Middlesex Deeds] Act 1891)
remain in operation, and are greatly valued by the smaller proprietors
and mortgagees, owing to the security against fraud which
they provide at a trifling cost. The selection of these counties seems
capricious: its probable explanation is that in them trade was
flourishing, and the fortunes made were frequently invested in land,
and a protection against secret encumbrances was most in demand.
In 1728 and 1732 Surrey and Derby petitioned, unsuccessfully, for
local registries. In 1735 the North Riding Deed Registry Act was
passed. In 1739 a General Registry bill passed the Commons, but
did not reach the Lords. Next year the Lords passed a similar bill,
but it did not reach the Commons. In 1759 a General Registry bill
was thrown out by a majority of one. In 1784 Northumberland unsuccessfully
petitioned for a local registry. After this the subject
went almost out of sight till the Real Property Commission of 1828.
They reported in 1830 in favour of a general register of deeds, but
though several bills were introduced, none were passed. In 1846 a
committee of the House of Lords reported that the marketable value
of real property was seriously diminished by the tedious and expensive
process of the transfer of land, and that a registry of title to
all real property was essential to the success of any attempt to
simplify the system of conveyancing. In 1850 a Royal Commission
reported in favour of a general register of deeds, and in 1851 Lord
Campbell introduced a bill accordingly, but it was opposed, and was
dropped. In 1853 Lord Cranworth introduced a bill, which passed
the Lords but not the Commons.</p>

<p>Hitherto only registration of deeds had been considered, but in
1854 a new Royal Commission was appointed, which reported in
1857 in favour of a register of title. The scheme they recommended
was substantially embodied in a bill introduced in 1859 by Lord
Cairns&mdash;then Solicitor-General&mdash;but a dissolution stopped its progress.
In 1862 Lord Westbury had the satisfaction of carrying the
first act for registration of title. This act enabled any landowner
to register an indefeasible title on production of strict proof. The
proof required was to be such as the court of chancery would force
an unwilling purchaser to accept. Only a few hundred titles were
registered under this act, and in 1868 a Royal Commission was appointed
to inquire into the causes of its failure. They reported in
1870, making various suggestions of detail, and especially adverting
to the great expense caused by the strictness of the official investigation
of title before a property could be admitted to the register.
In the same year Lord Hatherley introduced a Transfer of Land Bill,
but it was not proceeded with. In 1873 Lord Selborne introduced a
Land Titles and Transfer Bill, following more or less the recommendations
of the report of 1870, proposing for the first time compulsory
registration of title upon every next sale after a prescribed
date. Lord Cairns again introduced this bill (with some modifications)
in 1874, but it had to be dropped. In 1875 Lord Cairns&rsquo;s Land
Transfer Act of that year was passed, which was much the same as
the former bill, but without compulsion. This act had no better
success in the way of voluntary general adoption than the act of
1862, but as its adoption has since been made compulsory, its provisions
are important. Its most noticeable feature, from a practical
point of view, is the additional prominence given to an expedient
called &ldquo;Possessory&rdquo; registration (which also existed under another
name in Lord Westbury&rsquo;s Act), whereby is removed the great initial
difficulty of placing titles on the register in the first instance. Two
sorts of registration were established, &ldquo;Absolute&rdquo; and &ldquo;Possessory.&rdquo;
The effect of an absolute registration was immediately to destroy all
claims adverse to the registered title. But this was only to be granted
on a regular investigation of title, which, though not so strict as under
the former act, yet necessarily involved time and cost. Possessory
registration, however, was to be granted to any one who could
show a prima facie title&mdash;a quick and cheap process. But the effect
of such registration would not be immediately felt. It would not
destroy existing adverse claims. It would only prevent new difficulties
from arising. In course of time such a title would be practically
as good as an absolute one. In 1885 the duke of Marlborough
introduced a bill for a registry of titles, and in the following vacation
Lord Davey wrote three letters to <i>The Times</i> advocating the same
thing on the general lines afterwards adopted.<a name="fa2c" id="fa2c" href="#ft2c"><span class="sp">2</span></a> In 1887 Lord
Halsbury, by introducing his Land Transfer Bill, commenced a
struggle with the opponents of reform, which, after ten years of
almost continuous effort, resulted in the passing of his act of 1897,
establishing compulsory registration of title. Lord Halsbury introduced
bills in 1887, 1888 and 1889. Lord Herschell, who succeeded
him after the change of government, introduced bills in 1893, 1894
and 1895, these last three being unanimously passed by the House of
Lords on every occasion. The bill of 1895 reached committee in the
Commons, but was stopped by the dissolution of parliament. In
1897 Lord Halsbury (who had returned to the woolsack) again introduced
the same bill with certain modifications which caused the
Incorporated Law Society to withdraw its opposition in the House
of Commons, and the act was finally passed on the last day of the
session. Under it the Privy Council has power to issue orders
declaring that on a certain date registration of title is to be compulsory
on sale in a given district. The effect of such an order is
to oblige every purchaser of land in the district after that date to
register a &ldquo;possessory title,&rdquo; immediately after his purchase. The
compulsory provisions of the act extend to freeholds and (by a rule
afterwards made) to leaseholds having forty years to run. No order
except the first can be made, save on the request of a county council.
The first order was made in July 1898. It embraced the whole
administrative county of London (including the City of London),
proceeding gradually by groups of parishes. Under this order
upwards of 122,000 titles had been registered by 1908, representing
a value exceeding one hundred millions sterling.</p>

<p>Under the operation of this act, at the expense of a slightly
increased cost on all transactions during a few years, persons dealing
with land in the county will ultimately experience great relief in the
matter both of cost and of delay. The costs of a sale (including
professional assistance, if required) will ultimately be for the vendor
about one-fifth, and for the purchaser (at the most usual values) less
than half, of the present expenses. The delay will be no more than
in dealings with stock. Mortgagees will also be protected from risks
of fraud, which at present are very appreciable, and of which the
Redgrave and Richards cases are recent examples. Further particulars
of the practical operation of the acts will be found in the
Registrar&rsquo;s Reports of 1902 and 1906, embracing the period from
1899 to 1905 inclusive, with comments on the general position,
suggestions for future legislation, &amp;c. In the autumn of 1908
a Royal Commission under the chairmanship of Lord St Aldwyn,
was appointed to inquire into the working of the Land Transfer
Acts. The evidence given before them in October, November and
December 1908 comprised a general exposition by the registrar of the
origin and history of the acts, and the principles of their working,
and suggestions for amendments in certain details. It also comprised
the experience of several landowners and others, who had
found the acts highly beneficial, and who had carried through a
large number of dealings under absolute titles, without professional
help, very quickly, and at a greatly reduced cost.</p>

<p><i>Scotland.</i>&mdash;In Scotland registration of <i>deeds</i> was established by
an act of 1617, which remained unaltered till 1845. There are also
acts of 1868 and 1874. The registry is in Edinburgh. Deeds are
registered almost invariably by full copy. The deeds are indexed
according to properties&mdash;each property having a separate number
and folio called a &ldquo;search sheet,&rdquo; on which all deeds affecting it are
referred to. About 40,000 deeds are registered annually. The
consequence of the existence of this register is to render fraud in title
absolutely unknown. Forty years is the usual period investigated.
The investigation can, if desired, be made from the records in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>165</span>
registry alone. The fees are trifling, but suffice to pay the expenses
of the office, which employs between 70 and 80 permanent officers
in addition to temporary assistants. The total costs of conveyancing
amount, roughly speaking, to between 1 and 2% on the purchase
money, and are equally shared between vendor and purchaser.
In 1906 a royal commission was appointed, with Lord Dunedin as
chairman, to inquire into the expediency of instituting in Scotland a
system of registration of title.</p>

<p><i>Australia and New Zealand.</i>&mdash;These states now furnish the most
conspicuous examples in the British empire of the success of registration
of <i>title</i>. But prior to the year 1857 they had only registration of
<i>deeds</i>, and the expense, delay and confusion resulting from the
frequent dealings appear to have been a crying evil. Sir Robert
Torrens, then registrar of deeds in South Australia, drew up and
carried an act establishing a register of title similar to the shipping
register. The act rapidly became popular, and was adopted (with
variations) in all the other Australasian states in the years 1861, 1862,
1870 and 1874. Consolidating and amending acts have since been
passed in most of these states. Only absolute title is registered. All
land granted by government, after the passing of the several acts,
is placed on the register compulsorily. But voluntary applications
are also made in very large numbers. It is said ordinary purchasers
will not buy land unless the vendor first registers the title. The fees
are very low&mdash;£1 to £3 is a usual maximum&mdash;though in some states,
<i>e.g.</i> Victoria, the fees rise indefinitely, <i>ad valorem</i>, at a rate of about
10s. per £1000. Insurance funds are established to provide compensation
for errors. At a recent date they amounted to over
£400,000, while only £14,600 odd had been paid in claims. All the
registries pay their own expenses. Bankers and men of business
generally are warm in their appreciation of the acts, which are
popularly called Torrens Acts, after their originator, who, though
not a lawyer, originated and carried through this important and
difficult legal work.</p>

<p><i>Canada.</i>&mdash;Registration of <i>title</i> was introduced in Vancouver Island
in 1861, was extended to the rest of British Columbia in 1870, and
was in 1885 adopted by Ontario, Manitoba and the North-West
Territories. Only Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince
Edward Island retain the old English system, plus registration of
deeds. The three provinces which have adopted registration of title
have adopted it in somewhat different forms. In British Columbia
it is similar to Lord Westbury&rsquo;s Act of 1862. The North-West
Territories follow closely the Torrens Acts. The Ontario Act is
almost a transcript of Lord Cairns&rsquo;s Act of 1875. The fees
are very low, seldom exceeding a few shillings, but all expenses
of the office are paid from this source. The Ontario registry
has five district offices, as well as the central one at Toronto.
This is apparently the only colonial registry not open to public
inspection.</p>

<p><i>Other British Colonies.</i>&mdash;In the other British colonies private
investigation of title, plus registration of deeds, is the prevailing
system, but registration of title has been introduced in one or two
instances.</p>

<p><i>Germany and Austria-Hungary.</i>&mdash;By far the most important
examples of registration of <i>title</i> at present existing&mdash;because they
show how the system works when applied to large European communities,
with all the intricacies and complications of modern civilized
life&mdash;are to be found in Germany and Austria-Hungary. In some
parts of these countries registration of title has been established for
several centuries&mdash;notably in Bohemia; in most parts it has existed
for the greater part of the 19th century; in some districts, again,
notably Tirol and the Rhine Provinces, it is still in course of introduction.
In all cases it appears to have been preceded by a system
of deed registration, which materially facilitated its introduction.
In some cases, Prussia, for instance, the former registers were kept
in such a way as to amount in themselves to little short of a registry
of title. Very low scales of fees suffice to pay all official expenses.
In Prussia the fees for registering sales begin at 5d. for a value of £1;
at £20 the fee is 2s 7d.; at £100 it is 7s. 3d.; at £1000 it is £1, 10s.;
at £5000, £4, 5s., and so on. In case of error, the officials are personally
liable; failing these, the state. Other states are very similar. In
1894, 1,159,995 transactions were registered in Prussia. In 1893,
938,708 were registered in Austria. Some idea of the extent to
which small holdings prevail in these countries may be gathered from
the fact that 36% of the sales and mortgages in Austria were for
under £8, 6s. 8d. value&mdash;74% were for under £50. Owing to the
ease and simplicity of the registers, it is not always necessary to
employ professional help. When such help is required, the fees are
low. In Vienna £1 is a very usual fee for the purchaser&rsquo;s lawyer.
£10 is seldom reached. In Germany the register is private. In
Austria it is open to public inspection. In these registers may be
found examples of large estates in the country with numerous
charges and encumbrances and dealings therewith; peasants&rsquo;
properties, in numerous scattered parcels, acquired and disposed of
at different times, and variously mortgaged; town and suburban
properties, flats, small farms, rights to light and air, rights of way,
family settlements, and dealings of all sorts&mdash;inheritances and wills,
partitions, bankruptcies, mortgages, and a great variety of dealings
therewith. The Continental systems are usually administered locally
in districts, about 20 to 30 m. across, attached to the local law courts.
In Baden and Württemberg every parish (commune) has its own
registry. All ordinary dealings are transacted with the greatest
expedition. Security is absolute.<a name="fa3c" id="fa3c" href="#ft3c"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p><i>The United States.</i>&mdash;Up to a late date the ordinary English system,
with registration of <i>deeds</i>, was universal in the United States. The
registries appear to go back practically to the original settlement of
the country. Registration is by full copy. It is said that in the
large towns the name indexes were often much overgrown owing to
the want of subdivision into smaller areas corresponding to the
parishes into which the Middlesex and Yorkshire indexes are divided.
In the New York registry not many years ago 25,000 deeds were
registered annually. At the same time 35,000 were registered in
Middlesex. Complaints are made by American lawyers of want of
accuracy in the indexes also. In 1890 an act was passed in New
York for splitting the indexes into &ldquo;blocks,&rdquo; which is believed to
have given much relief. The average time and cost of an examination
of title, as estimated by a committee of the Bar Association of
New York in 1887, was about thirty days and 150 dollars (about
£30). A later State Commission in Illinois estimates the law costs of
a sale there at about 25 dollars (£5); the time may run into many
months. Allusion has already been made to the insurance of title
companies. The rates of insurance are substantial, <i>e.g.</i> 65 dollars
(£13) on the first 3000 dollars (£600), and 5 dollars (£1) on each
additional 1000 dollars (£200). This would amount to £20 on £2000
value, £110 on £20,000, £510 on £100,000. The guarantee given is
very ample, and may be renewed to subsequent owners at one-third
of the fee. Registration of title has lately been introduced, on a
voluntary basis, into the states of California, Oregon, Illinois,
Massachusetts, Minnesota and Colorado, and also into Hawaii and
the Philippines.</p>

<p><i>France.</i>&mdash;In France registration of <i>deeds</i> is universal. Sales,
mortgages, gifts and successions; easements, leases of over eighteen
years, and transactions affecting the land to the extent of three years&rsquo;
rent may lose priority if not registered. Wills need not be registered.
Mortgages must be re-registered every ten years. Purchase deeds
are registered by filing full copies. Registries are established in all
the considerable towns. The duty on sales amounts to the high
figure of about 6½% on the value. Part of this is allocated to
registration, in addition to which a fixed fee of one franc, and
stationers&rsquo; charges averaging 6 francs are also chargeable. The title
can usually be fully investigated from the documents in the registry.
Official searches for mortgages are commonly resorted to, at a cost
of about 5 francs. Under the monarchy the land system was practically
copyhold tenure, but greater validity was attached to the Court
Rolls than was the case in England. The present system was
established by a law of 1790 after the abolition of seigniorial institutions
in 1789. This was modified by the Code Napoleon, and further
perfected by a law of 1855. The average value of transactions in
France is very small. Probably at the present time four-fifths of the
properties are of under £25 value. The costs of a sale for 200 francs
(£8) would be about as follows: Duty, 13 fr.; Notary (1%), 2 fr.;
expenses, 12 fr.&mdash;total 27 fr. A sale for 1000 fr. (£40) would cost
about 110 fr. Taking all values, the cost of conveyance and duty
reaches the high figure of 10% in the general run of transactions.
The vendor as a rule has no costs. <i>Indefeasible</i> title is not obtainable,
but frauds are almost unknown. A day or two usually suffices for all
formalities. On large sales a further process known as the &ldquo;purge&rdquo;
is undergone, which requires a few weeks and more expense, in order
to guard against possible claims against which the deed registries
afford no protection, such as dowries of wives, claims under guardianships,
&amp;c. A commission (Commission Extraparlementaire du
Cadastre), appointed in 1891 to consider the revision of the government
cadastral maps (which are in very serious arrear) and the
establishment of registration of title, collected, in nine volumes of
Comptes Rendus, a great mass of most interesting particulars relating
to land questions in France, and in 1905 reported in favour of
the general establishment of a register of title, with a draft of the
necessary enactment.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANDSEER, SIR EDWIN HENRY<a name="ar61" id="ar61"></a></span> (1802-1873), English
painter, third son of John Landseer, A.R.A., a well-known
engraver and writer on art, was born at 71 Queen Anne Street
East (afterwards 33 Foley Street), London, on March 7th 1802.
His mother was Miss Potts, who sat to Sir Joshua Reynolds
as the reaper with a sheaf of corn on her head, in &ldquo;Macklin&rsquo;s
Family Picture,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Gleaners.&rdquo;<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Edwin Henry Landseer
began his artistic education under his father so successfully
that in his fifth year he drew fairly well, and was familiar with
animal character and passion. Drawings of his, at South
Kensington, dated by his father, attest that he drew excellently
at eight years of age; at ten he was an admirable draughtsman
and his work shows considerable sense of humour. At thirteen
he drew a majestic St Bernard dog so finely that his brother
Thomas engraved and published the work. At this date (1815)
he sent two pictures to the Royal Academy, and was described
in the catalogue as &ldquo;Master E. Landseer, 33 Foley Street.&rdquo;
Youth forbade his being reckoned among practising artists,
and caused him to be considered as the &ldquo;Honorary Exhibitor&rdquo;
of &ldquo;No. 443, Portrait of a Mule,&rdquo; and &ldquo;No. 584, Portraits
of a Pointer Bitch and Puppy.&rdquo; Adopting the advice of B. R.
Haydon, he studied the Elgin Marbles, the animals in the Tower
of London and Exeter &lsquo;Change, and dissected every animal
whose carcass he could obtain. In 1816 Landseer was admitted
a student of the Royal Academy schools. In 1817 he sent to the
Academy a portrait of &ldquo;Old Brutus,&rdquo; a much-favoured dog,
which, as well as its son, another Brutus, often appeared in his
later pictures. Even at this date Landseer enjoyed considerable
reputation, and had more work than he could readily perform,
his renown having been zealously fostered by his father in James
Elmes&rsquo;s <i>Annals of the Fine Arts</i>. At the Academy he was a
diligent student and a favourite of Henry Fuseli&rsquo;s, who would
look about the crowded antique school and ask, &ldquo;Where is my
curly-headed dog-boy?&rdquo; Although his pictures sold easily
from the first, the prices he received at this time were comparatively
small. In 1818 Landseer sent to the Society of Painters
in Oil and Water Colours, which then held its exhibitions in
Spring Gardens, his picture of &ldquo;Fighting Dogs getting Wind.&rdquo;
The sale of this work to Sir George Beaumont vastly enhanced
the fame of the painter, who soon became &ldquo;the fashion.&rdquo; This
picture illustrates the prime strength of Landseer&rsquo;s earlier style.
Unlike the productions of his later life, it displays not an iota
of sentiment. Perfectly drawn, solidly and minutely finished,
and carefully composed, its execution attested the skill acquired
during ten years&rsquo; studies from nature. Between 1818 and 1825
Landseer did a great deal of work, but on the whole gained
little besides facility of technical expression, a greater zest for
humour and a larger style. The work of this stage ended with
the production of the painting called &ldquo;The Cat&rsquo;s Paw,&rdquo; which
was sent to the British Institution in 1824, and made an enormous
sensation. The price obtained for this picture, £100, enabled
Landseer to set up for himself in the house No. 1 St John&rsquo;s Wood
Road, where he lived nearly fifty years and in which he died.
During this period Landseer&rsquo;s principal pictures were &ldquo;The Cat
Disturbed&rdquo;; &ldquo;Alpine Mastiffs reanimating a Distressed
Traveller,&rdquo; a famous work engraved by his father; &ldquo;The
Ratcatchers&rdquo;; &ldquo;Pointers to be&rdquo;; &ldquo;The Larder Invaded&rdquo;;
and &ldquo;Neptune,&rdquo; the head and shoulders of a Newfoundland dog.
In 1824 Landseer and C. R. Leslie made a journey to the Highlands&mdash;a
momentous visit for the former, who thenceforward
rarely failed annually to repeat it in search of studies and subjects.</p>

<p>In 1826 Landseer was elected an A.R.A. In 1827 appeared
&ldquo;The Monkey who has seen the World,&rdquo; a picture which marked
the growth of a taste for humorous subjects in the mind of the
painter that had been evoked by the success of the &ldquo;Cat&rsquo;s Paw.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Taking a Buck&rdquo; (1825) was the painter&rsquo;s first Scottish picture.
Its execution marked a change in his style which, in increase
of largeness, was a great improvement. In other respects,
however, there was a decrease of solid qualities; indeed, finish,
searching modelling, and elaborate draughtsmanship rarely
appeared in Landseer&rsquo;s work after 1823. The subject, as such,
soon after this time became a very distinct element in his pictures;
ultimately it dominated, and in effect the artist enjoyed a greater
degree of popularity than technical judgment justified, so that
later criticism has put Landseer&rsquo;s position in art much lower
than the place he once occupied. Sentiment gave new charm
to his works, which had previously depended on the expression
of animal passion and character, and the exhibition of noble
qualities of draughtsmanship. Sentimentality ruled in not a
few pictures of later dates, and <i>quasi</i>-human humour, or pathos,
superseded that masculine animalism which rioted in its energy,
and enabled the artist to rival Snyders, if not Velazquez, as a
painter of beasts. After &ldquo;High Life&rdquo; and &ldquo;Low Life,&rdquo; now in
the Tate Gallery, London, Landseer&rsquo;s dogs, and even his lions
and birds, were sometimes more than half civilized. It was not
that these later pictures were less true to nature than their
forerunners, but the models were chosen from different grades
of animal society. As Landseer prospered he kept finer company,
and his new patrons did not care about rat-catching and dog-fighting,
however vigorously and learnedly those subjects
might be depicted. It cannot be said that the world lost much
when, in exchange for the &ldquo;Cat Disturbed&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fighting
Dogs getting Wind,&rdquo; came &ldquo;Jack in Office,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Old Shepherd&rsquo;s
Chief Mourner,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Swannery invaded by Eagles,&rdquo;
three pictures which are types of as many diverse moods of
Landseer&rsquo;s art, and each a noble one.</p>

<p>Landseer was elected a Royal Academician in 1831. &ldquo;Chevy
Chase&rdquo; (1826), which is at Woburn, &ldquo;The Highland Whisky
Still&rdquo; (1829), &ldquo;High Life&rdquo; (1829) and &ldquo;Low Life&rdquo; (1829),
besides other important works, had appeared in the interval.
Landseer had by this time attained such amazing mastery that
he painted &ldquo;Spaniel and Rabbit&rdquo; in two hours and a half,
and &ldquo;Rabbits,&rdquo; which was at the British Institution, in three-quarters
of an hour; and the fine dog-picture &ldquo;Odin&rdquo; (1836)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>167</span>
was the work of one sitting, <i>i.e.</i> painted within twelve hours.
But perhaps the most wonderful instance of his rapid but sure
and dexterous brush-handling was &ldquo;The Cavalier&rsquo;s Pets&rdquo;
(1845), the picture of two King Charles&rsquo;s spaniels in the National
Gallery, which was executed in two days. Another remarkable
feat consisted in drawing, simultaneously, a stag&rsquo;s head with
one hand and a head of a horse with the other. &ldquo;Harvest in
the Highlands,&rdquo; and that masterpiece of humour, &ldquo;Jack in
Office,&rdquo; were exhibited in 1833. In 1834 a noble work of sentiment
was given to the world in &ldquo;Suspense,&rdquo; which is now at
South Kensington, and shows a dog watching at the closed door
of his wounded master. Many think this to be Landseer&rsquo;s
finest work, others prefer &ldquo;The Old Shepherd&rsquo;s Chief Mourner&rdquo;
(1837). The over-praised and unfortunate &ldquo;Bolton Abbey in
the Olden Time,&rdquo; a group of portraits in character, was also
shown in 1834, and was the first picture for which the painter
received £400. A few years later he sold &ldquo;Peace&rdquo; and &ldquo;War&rdquo;
for £1500, and for the copyrights alone obtained £6000. In
1881 &ldquo;Man proposes, God Disposes&rdquo; (1864) was resold for 6300
guineas, and a cartoon of &ldquo;The Chase&rdquo; (1866) fetched 5000
guineas. &ldquo;A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society,&rdquo;
a dog reclining on a quay wall (1838), was succeeded by &ldquo;Dignity
and Impudence&rdquo; (1839). The &ldquo;Lion Dog of Malta,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Laying down the Law&rdquo; appeared in 1840. In 1842 was
finished the capital &ldquo;Highland Shepherd&rsquo;s Home&rdquo; (Sheepshanks
Gift), together with the beautiful &ldquo;Eos,&rdquo; a portrait of
Prince Albert&rsquo;s most graceful of greyhounds, to which Thomas
Landseer added an ineffable charm and solidity not in the painting.
The &ldquo;Rout of Comus&rdquo; was painted in the summerhouse
of Buckingham Palace garden in 1843. The &ldquo;Challenge&rdquo;
was accompanied (1844) by &ldquo;Shoeing the Bay Mare&rdquo; (Bell
Gift), and followed by &ldquo;Peace&rdquo; and &ldquo;War,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Stag
at Bay&rdquo; (1846). &ldquo;Alexander and Diogenes,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Random
Shot,&rdquo; a dead kid lying in the snow, came forth in 1848. In
1850 Landseer received a national commission to paint in the
Houses of Parliament three subjects connected with the chase.
Although they would have been worth three times as much
money, the House of Commons refused to grant £1500 for these
pictures, and the matter fell through, more to the artist&rsquo;s profit
than the nation&rsquo;s gain. The famous &ldquo;Monarch of the Glen&rdquo;
(1851) was one of these subjects. &ldquo;Night&rdquo; and &ldquo;Morning,&rdquo;
romantic and pathetic deer subjects, came in due order (1853).
For &ldquo;The Sanctuary&rdquo; (1842) the Fine Arts jury of experts
awarded to the artist the great gold medal of the Exposition
Universelle, Paris, 1855.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Dialogue at Waterloo&rdquo; (1850), which he afterwards
regarded with strong disapproval, showed how Landseer, like
nearly all English artists of original power and considerable
fertility, owed nothing to French or Italian training. In the
same year he received the honour of knighthood. Next came
&ldquo;Geneva&rdquo; (1851), &ldquo;Titania and Bottom&rdquo; (1851), which comprises
a charming queen of the fairies, and the &ldquo;Deer Pass&rdquo;
(1852), followed by &ldquo;The Children of the Mist&rdquo; (1853), &ldquo;Saved&rdquo;
(1856), &ldquo;Braemar,&rdquo; a noble stag, &ldquo;Rough and Ready,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Uncle Tom and his Wife for Sale&rdquo; (1857). &ldquo;The Maid and
the Magpie&rdquo; (1858), the extraordinarily large cartoon called
&ldquo;Deer Browsing&rdquo; (1857), &ldquo;The Twa Dogs&rdquo; (1858), and one
or two minor paintings were equal to any previously produced
by the artist. Nevertheless, signs of failing health were remarked
in &ldquo;Doubtful Crumbs&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Kind Star&rdquo; (1859). The
immense and profoundly dramatic picture called &ldquo;A Flood in
the Highlands&rdquo; (1860) more than reinstated the painter before
the public, but friends still saw ground for uneasiness. Extreme
nervous excitability manifested itself in many ways, and in
the choice (1864) of the dreadful subject of &ldquo;Man Proposes,
God Disposes,&rdquo; bears clumsily clambering among relics of Sir
John Franklin&rsquo;s party, there was occult pathos, which some of
the artist&rsquo;s intimates suspected, but did not avow. In 1862
and 1863 Landseer produced nothing; but &ldquo;A Piper and a Pair
of Nutcrackers&rdquo; (1864) revealed his old power. He declined
the presidentship of the Royal Academy in 1865, in succession
to Sir Charles Eastlake. In 1867 the four lions which he had
modelled for the base of the Nelson Monument in Trafalgar
Square, London, were unveiled, and with &ldquo;The Swannery invaded
by Eagles&rdquo; (1869) he achieved his last triumph. After four
years more, full of suffering, mainly of broken art and shattered
mental powers, Sir Edwin Landseer died on the 1st of October
1873, and was buried, ten days later, in St Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral.
Those who would see the full strength of Landseer&rsquo;s brush should
examine his sketches and the like in the Victoria and Albert
Museum and similar works. In these he shows himself endowed
with the strength of Paul Potter.</p>

Dangerous reefs lie off the point, and one group a mile from the
mainland is marked by the Longships Lighthouse, in 50° 4&prime; N.
5° 43&prime; W. The Land&rsquo;s End is the westernmost of the granite

<p><span class="bold">LANDSHUT,<a name="ar63" id="ar63"></a></span> a town in the kingdom of Bavaria, on the right
bank of the Isar, 40 m. N.E. of Munich on the main line of railway
to Regensburg. Pop. (1905) 24,217. Landshut is still a
quaint, picturesque place; it consists of an old and a new town
and of four suburbs, one part of it lying on an island in the Isar.
It contains a fine street, the Altstadt, and several interesting
medieval buildings. Among its eleven churches the most noteworthy
are those of St Martin, with a tower 432 ft. high, of St
Jodocus, and of the Holy Ghost, or the Hospital church, all three
begun before 1410. The former Dominican convent, founded
in 1271, once the seat of the university, is now used as public
offices. The post-office, formerly the meeting-house of the
Estates, a building adorned with old frescoes; the royal palace,
which contains some very fine Renaissance work; and the town-hall,
built in 1446 and restored in 1860, are also noteworthy.
The town has monuments to the Bavarian king, Maximilian II.,
and to other famous men; it contains a botanical garden and
a public park. On a hill overlooking Landshut is the castle
of Trausnitz, called also Burg Landshut, formerly a stronghold
of the dukes of Lower Bavaria, whose burial-place was at
Seligenthal also near the town. The original building was erected
early in the 13th century, but the chapel, the oldest part now
existing, dates from the 14th century. The upper part of the
castle has been made habitable. The industries of Landshut
are not important; they include brewing, tanning and spinning,
and the manufacture of tobacco and cloth. Market gardening
and an extensive trade in grain are also carried on.</p>

<p>Landshut was founded about 1204, and from 1255 to 1503
it was the principal residence of the dukes of Lower Bavaria
and of their successors, the dukes of Bavaria-Landshut. During
the Thirty Years&rsquo; War it was captured several times by the
Swedes and in the 18th century by the Austrians. In April
1809 Napoleon defeated the Austrians here and the town was
stormed by his troops. From 1800 to 1826 the university,
formerly at Ingolstadt and now at Munich, was located at Landshut.
Owing to the three helmets which form its arms the town
is sometimes called &ldquo;Dreihelm Stadt.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANDSKNECHT,<a name="ar64" id="ar64"></a></span> a German mercenary foot-soldier of the
16th century. The name (German for &ldquo;man of the plains&rdquo;)
was given to mark the contrast between the force of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>168</span>
soldiers, formed by the emperor Maximilian I. about the end
of the 15th century, and the Swiss, the &ldquo;men of the mountains,&rdquo;
at that time the typical mercenary infantry of Europe. After
the battles of Marignan and Pavia, where the military reputation
of the Swiss had been broken, the Swabian <i>landsknechte</i>
came to be considered the best fighting troops in Europe. Though
primarily a German force and always the mainstay of imperial
armies, they served in organized bodies as mercenaries elsewhere
in Europe; in France they fought for the League and for the
Protestants indiscriminately. In fact <i>landsknecht</i>, and more
particularly its French corruption <i>lansquenet</i>, became in western
Europe a general term for mercenary foot-soldiers. It is owing
to the <i>lange Spiesse</i> (long pike or lance), the typical weapon
with which they were armed, that the corrupted French form,
as well as a German form, <i>lanzknecht</i>, and an English &ldquo;lance-knight&rdquo;
came into use.</p>

<p>The landsknechts were raised by colonels (<i>Oberst</i>), to whom
the emperor issued recruiting commissions corresponding to the
English &ldquo;indents&rdquo;; they were organized in regiments made up
of a colonel, lieut.-colonel and regimental staff, with a varying
number of companies, &ldquo;colours&rdquo; (<i>Fähnlein</i>), commanded by
captains (<i>Hauptmann</i>); subaltern officers were lieutenants
and ensigns (<i>Fähnrich</i>). In thus defining the titles and duties
of each rank, and in almost every detail of regimental customs
and organization, discipline and interior economy, the landsknechts
may be considered as the founders of the modern
military system on a regimental basis (see further <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Army</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANDSKRONA<a name="ar65" id="ar65"></a></span>, a seaport of Sweden, on the east side of the
Sound, 15 m. N.E. of Copenhagen. Pop. (1900) 14,399. The
harbour is excellent, giving a depth of 35 ft., with 15 ft. beside
the quays. The town is among the first twelve manufacturing
centres of Sweden in value of output, the principal industries
being tanning and sugar manufacture and refining from beetroot.
On the little island of Hven, immediately opposite the town, Tycho
Brahe built his famous subterranean observatory of Uranienborg
in the second half of the 16th century. Landskrona,
originally called Landora or Landör, owed its first importance
to King Erik XIII., who introduced a body of Carmelite monks
from Germany in 1410, and bestowed on the place the privileges
of a town. During the wars of the 16th and 17th centuries it
played too conspicuous a part for its own prosperity. On the
24th of July 1677 a great naval battle was fought in the neighbourhood
in which the Swedes defeated the Danes.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANDWEHR<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span>, a German word meaning &ldquo;defence of the
country&rdquo;; but the term as applied to an insurrectional militia
is very ancient, and &ldquo;lantveri&rdquo; are mentioned in <i>Baluzii
Capitularia</i>, as quoted in Hallam&rsquo;s <i>Middle Ages</i>, i. 262, 10th ed.
The landwehr in Prussia was first formed by a royal edict of
the 17th of March 1813, which called up all men capable of
bearing arms between the ages of eighteen and forty-five, and
not serving in the regular army, for the defence of the country.
After the peace of 1815 this force was made an integral part of
the Prussian army, each brigade being composed of one line and
one landwehr regiment. This, however, retarded the mobilization
and diminished the value of the first line, and by the
re-organization of 1859 the landwehr troops were relegated to
the second line. In Austria the landwehr is a totally different
organization. It is in reality a <i>cadre</i> force existing alongside
the regular army, and to it are handed over such recruits as,
for want of vacancies, cannot be placed in the latter. In Switzerland
the landwehr is a second line force, in which all citizens
serve for twelve years, after passing twelve in the &ldquo;Auszug&rdquo; or
field army.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LANE, EDWARD WILLIAM<a name="ar68" id="ar68"></a></span> (1801-1876), English Arabic
scholar, son of Dr Theophilus Lane, prebendary of Hereford,
was born on the 17th of September 1801. He was educated at
Bath and Hereford grammar schools, where he showed marked
mathematical ability, and was designed for Cambridge and the
church, but this purpose was abandoned, and for some time he
studied the art of engraving. Failure of health compelled him
to throw aside the burin, and in 1825 he started for Egypt, where
he spent three years, twice ascended the Nile, proceeding as far
as the second cataract, and composed a complete description of
Egypt, with a portfolio of one hundred and one drawings. This
work was never published, but the account of the modern
Egyptians, which formed a part of it, was accepted for separate
publication by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge.
To perfect this work Lane again visited Egypt in 1833-1835,
residing mainly in Cairo, but retiring to Luxor during the plague
of 1835. Lane took up his residence in the Mahommedan
quarter, and under the name of Mansur Effendi lived the life
of an Egyptian scholar. He was fortunate in the time when he
took up his work, for Cairo had not then become a modern city,
and he was thus able to describe aspects of Arabian life that no
longer exist there. Perfected by the additional observations
collected during these years, the <i>Modern Egyptians</i> appeared in
1836, and at once took the place which it has never lost as the
best description of Eastern life and an Eastern country ever
written. It was followed from 1838 to 1840 by a translation of
the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, with notes and illustrations, designed to
make the book a sort of encyclopaedia of Eastern manners.
The translation itself is an admirable proof of scholarship, but
is characterized by a somewhat stilted mannerism, which is
not equally appropriate to all parts of the motley-coloured
original. The character of some of the tales and the tedious
repetitions of the same theme in the Arabic collection induced
Lane to leave considerable parts of the work untranslated.
The value of his version is increased by the exhaustive notes on
Mahommedan life and customs. In 1840 Lane married a Greek
lady. A useful volume of <i>Selections from the Kur-&#257;n</i> was published
in 1843, but before it passed through the press Lane was again
in Egypt, where he spent seven years (1842-1849) collecting
materials for a great Arabic lexicon, which the munificence of
Lord Prudhoe (afterwards duke of Northumberland) enabled
him to undertake. The most important of the materials amassed
during this sojourn (in which he was accompanied by his wife
and by his sister, Mrs Poole, authoress of the <i>Englishwoman in
Egypt</i>, with her two sons, afterwards well known in Eastern
letters) was a copy in 24 thick quarto volumes of Sheikh Murtad&#257;&rsquo;s
great lexicon, the <i>T&#257;j el &lsquo;Ar&#363;s</i>, which, though itself a
compilation, is so extensive and exact that it formed the main
basis of Lane&rsquo;s subsequent work. The author, who lived in
Egypt in the 18th century, used more than a hundred sources,
interweaving what he learned from them with the <i>al-Q&#257;m&#363;s</i> of
Fair&#363;z&#257;b&#257;d&#299; in the form of a commentary. By far the larger
part of this commentary was derived from the <i>Lis&#257;n el &lsquo;Arab</i> of
Ibn Mokarram, a work of the 13th century, which Lane was also
able to use while in Cairo.</p>

<p>Returning to England in 1849, Lane devoted the remaining
twenty-seven years of his life to digesting and translating his
Arabic material in the form of a great thesaurus of the lexicographical
knowledge of the Arabs. In spite of weak health he
continued this arduous task with unflagging diligence till a few
days before his death at Worthing on the 10th of August 1876.
Five parts appeared during his lifetime (1863-1874), and three
posthumous parts were afterwards edited from his papers by
S. Lane-Poole. Even in its imperfect state the <i>Lexicon</i> is an
enduring monument, the completeness and finished scholarship
with which it is executed making each article an exhaustive
monograph. Two essays, the one on Arabic lexicography and
the other on Arabic pronunciation, contributed to the magazine
of the German Oriental Society, complete the record of Lane&rsquo;s
publications. His scholarship was recognized by many learned
European societies. He was a member of the German Oriental
Society, a correspondent of the French Institute, &amp;c. In 1863
he was awarded a small civil list pension, which was after his
death continued to his widow. Lane was not an original mind;
his powers were those of observation, industry and sound
judgment. His personal character was elevated and pure, his
strong sense of religious and moral duty being of the type that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>169</span>
characterized the best circles of English evangelicalism in the
early part of the 19th century.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A Memoir, by his grand-nephew, S. Lane-Poole, was prefixed to
part vi. of the <i>Lexicon</i>. It was published separately in 1877.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANE, GEORGE MARTIN<a name="ar69" id="ar69"></a></span> (1823-1897), American scholar,
was born at Charlestown, Massachusetts, on the 24th of December
1823. He graduated in 1846 at Harvard, and in 1847-1851
studied at the universities of Berlin, Bonn, Heidelberg and
Göttingen. In 1851 he received his doctor&rsquo;s degree at Göttingen
for his dissertation <i>Smyrnaeorum Res Gestae et Antiquitates</i>,
and on his return to America he was appointed University
Professor of Latin in Harvard College. From 1869 until 1894,
when he resigned and became professor emeritus, he was Pope
Professor of Latin in the same institution. His <i>Latin Pronunciation</i>,
which led to the rejection of the English method of
Latin pronunciation in the United States, was published in 1871.
He died on the 30th of June 1897. His <i>Latin Grammar</i>, completed
and published by Professor M. H. Morgan in the following
year, is of high value. Lane&rsquo;s assistance in the preparation of
Harper&rsquo;s Latin lexicons was also invaluable. English light
verse he wrote with humour and fluency, and his song <i>Jonah</i>
and the <i>Ballad of the Lone Fishball</i> were famous.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANE, JAMES HENRY<a name="ar70" id="ar70"></a></span> (1814-1866), American soldier and
politician, was born at Lawrenceburg, Indiana, on the 22nd of
June 1814. He was the son of Amos Lane (1778-1849), a
political leader in Indiana, a member of the Indiana House of
Representatives in 1816-1818 (speaker in 1817-1818), in 1821-1822
and in 1839-1840, and from 1833 to 1837 a Democratic
representative in Congress. The son received a common school
education, studied law and in 1840 was admitted to the bar.
In the Mexican War he served as a colonel under General Taylor,
and then commanded the Fifth Indiana regiment (which he had
raised) in the Southern Campaign under General Scott. Lane
was lieutenant-governor of Indiana from 1849 to 1853, and from
1853 to 1855 was a Democratic representative in Congress. His
vote in favour of the Kansas-Nebraska Bill ruined his political
future in his own state, and he emigrated in 1855 to the Territory
of Kansas, probably as an agent of Stephen A. Douglas to organize
the Democratic party there. He soon joined the Free State
forces, however, was a member of the first general Free State
convention at Big Springs in September 1855, and wrote its
&ldquo;platform,&rdquo; which deprecated abolitionism and urged the
exclusion of negroes from the Territory; and he presided over
the Topeka Constitutional Convention, composed of Free State
men, in the autumn of 1855. Lane was second in command of
the forces in Lawrence during the &ldquo;Wakarusa War&rdquo;; and in the
spring of 1856 was elected a United States senator under the
Topeka Constitution, the validity of which, however, and
therefore the validity of his election, Congress refused to recognize.
In May 1856, with George Washington Deitzler (1826-1884),
Dr Charles Robinson, and other Free State leaders, he was
indicted for treason; but he escaped from Kansas, made a tour
of the northern cities, and by his fiery oratory aroused great
enthusiasm in behalf of the Free State movement in Kansas.
Returning to the Territory with John Brown in August 1856,
he took an active part in the domestic feuds of 1856-1857.
After Kansas became a state, Lane was elected in 1861 to the
United States Senate as a Republican. Immediately on reaching
Washington he organized a company to guard the President;
and in August 1861, having gained the ear of the Federal authorities
and become intimate with President Lincoln, he went to
Kansas with vague military powers, and exercised them in spite
of the protests of the governor and the regular departmental commanders.
During the autumn, with a brigade of 1500 men, he
conducted a devastating campaign on the Missouri border, and
in July 1862 he was appointed commissioner of recruiting for
Kansas, a position in which he rendered faithful service, though
he frequently came into conflict with the state authorities. At
this time he planned a chimerical &ldquo;great Southern expedition&rdquo;
against New Mexico, but this came to nothing. In 1864 he
laboured earnestly for the re-election of Lincoln. When President
Johnson quarrelled with the Radical Republicans, Lane deserted
the latter and defended the Executive. Angered by his defection,
certain senators accused him of being implicated in Indian
contracts of a fraudulent character; and in a fit of depression
following this accusation he took his own life, dying near Fort
Leavenworth, Kansas, on the 11th of July 1866, ten days after
he had shot himself in the head. Ambitious, unscrupulous, rash
and impulsive, and generally regarded by his contemporaries
as an unsafe leader, Lane was a man of great energy and personal
magnetism, and possessed oratorical powers of a high order.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANESSAN, JEAN MARIE ANTOINE DE<a name="ar71" id="ar71"></a></span> (1843-&emsp;&emsp;),
French statesman and naturalist, was born at Sainte-André de
Cubzac (Gironde) on the 13th of July 1843. He entered the
navy in 1862, serving on the East African and Cochin-China
stations in the medical department until the Franco-German
War, when he resigned and volunteered for the army medical
service. He now completed his studies, taking his doctorate
in 1872. Elected to the Municipal Council of Paris in 1879, he
declared in favour of communal autonomy and joined with Henri
Rochefort in demanding the erection of a monument to the
Communards; but after his election to the Chamber of Deputies
for the 5th arrondissement of Paris in 1881 he gradually veered
from the extreme Radical party to the Republican Union, and
identified himself with the cause of colonial expansion. A
government mission to the French colonies in 1886-1887, in
connexion with the approaching Paris exhibition, gave him the
opportunity of studying colonial questions, on which, after his
return, he published three works: <i>La Tunisie</i> (Paris, 1887);
<i>L&rsquo;Expansion coloniale de la France</i> (<i>ib.</i>, 1888), <i>L&rsquo;Indo-Chine
française</i> (<i>ib.</i>, 1889). In 1891 he was made civil and military
governor of French Indo-China, where his administration, which
involved him in open rupture with Admiral Fournier, was
severely criticized. Nevertheless he consolidated French influence
in Annam and Cambodia, and secured a large accession
of territory on the Mekong river from the kingdom of Siam.
He was recalled in 1894, and published an apology for his
administration (<i>La Colonisation française en Indo-Chine</i>) in the
following year. In the Waldeck-Rousseau cabinet of 1899 to
1902 he was minister of marine, and in 1901 he secured the
passage of a naval programme intended to raise the French
navy during the next six years to a level befitting the place
of France among the great powers. At the general election of
1906 he was not re-elected. He was political director of the
<i>Siècle</i>, and president of the French Colonization Society, and
wrote, besides the books already mentioned, various works on
political and biological questions.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANFRANC<a name="ar72" id="ar72"></a></span> (d. 1089), archbishop of Canterbury, was a
Lombard by extraction. He was born in the early years of
the 11th century at Pavia, where his father, Hanbald, held the
rank of a magistrate. Lanfranc was trained in the legal studies
for which northern Italy was then becoming famous, and
acquired such proficiency that tradition links him with Irnerius
of Bologna as a pioneer in the renaissance of Roman law. Though
designed for a public career Lanfranc had the tastes of a student.
After his father&rsquo;s death he crossed the Alps to found a school
in France; but in a short while he decided that Normandy
would afford him a better field. About 1039 he became the
master of the cathedral school at Avranches, where he taught
for three years with conspicuous success. But in <span class="correction" title="amended from 1142">1042</span> he
embraced the monastic profession in the newly founded house
of Bec. Until <span class="correction" title="amended from 1145">1045</span> he lived at Bec in absolute seclusion. He
was then persuaded by Abbot Herluin to open a school in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>170</span>
monastery. From the first he was celebrated (<i>totius Latinitatis
magister</i>). His pupils were drawn not only from France and
Normandy, but also from Gascony, Flanders, Germany and
Italy. Many of them afterwards attained high positions in the
Church; one, Anselm of Badagio, became pope under the title
of Alexander II. In this way Lanfranc set the seal of intellectual
activity on the reform movement of which Bec was the centre.
The favourite subjects of his lectures were logic and dogmatic
theology. He was therefore naturally invited to defend the
doctrine of transubstantiation against the attacks of Berengar
of Tours. He took up the task with the greatest zeal, although
Berengar had been his personal friend; he was the protagonist of
orthodoxy at the councils of Vercelli (1050), Tours (1054) and
Rome (1059). To his influence we may attribute the desertion
of Berengar&rsquo;s cause by Hildebrand and the more broad-minded
of the cardinals. Our knowledge of Lanfranc&rsquo;s polemics is
chiefly derived from the tract <i>De corpore et sanguine Domini</i>
which he wrote many years later (after 1079) when Berengar
had been finally condemned. Though betraying no signs of
metaphysical ability, his work was regarded as conclusive and
became a text-book in the schools. It is the most important
of the works attributed to Lanfranc; which, considering his
reputation, are slight and disappointing.</p>

<p>In the midst of his scholastic and controversial activities
Lanfranc became a political force. While merely a prior of
Bec he led the opposition to the uncanonical marriage of Duke
William with Matilda of Flanders (1053) and carried matters
so far that he incurred a sentence of exile. But the quarrel
was settled when he was on the point of departure, and he
undertook the difficult task of obtaining the pope&rsquo;s approval
of the marriage. In this he was successful at the same council
which witnessed his third victory over Berengar (1059), and
he thus acquired a lasting claim on William&rsquo;s gratitude. In
1066 he became the first abbot of St Stephen&rsquo;s at Caen, a house
which the duke had been enjoined to found as a penance for
his disobedience to the Holy See. Henceforward Lanfranc
exercised a perceptible influence on his master&rsquo;s policy. William
adopted the Cluniac programme of ecclesiastical reform, and
obtained the support of Rome for his English expedition by
assuming the attitude of a crusader against schism and corruption.
It was Alexander II., the former pupil of Lanfranc, who
gave the Norman Conquest the papal benediction&mdash;a notable
advantage to William at the moment, but subsequently the
cause of serious embarrassments.</p>

<p>Naturally, when the see of Rouen next fell vacant (1067),
the thoughts of the electors turned to Lanfranc. But he declined
the honour, and he was nominated to the English primacy as
soon as Stigand had been canonically deposed (1070). The new
archbishop at once began a policy of reorganization and reform.
His first difficulties were with Thomas of Bayeux, archbishop-elect
of York, who asserted that his see was independent of
Canterbury and claimed jurisdiction over the greater part of
midland England. Lanfranc, during a visit which he paid the
pope for the purpose of receiving his pallium, obtained an order
from Alexander that the disputed points should be settled by a
council of the English Church. This was held at Winchester
in 1072. Thanks to a skilful use of forged documents, the primate
carried the council&rsquo;s verdict upon every point. Even if he were
not the author of the forgeries he can scarcely have been the
dupe of his own partisans. But the political dangers to be
apprehended from the disruption of the English Church were
sufficiently serious to palliate the fraud. This was not the only
occasion on which Lanfranc allowed his judgment to be warped
by considerations of expediency. Although the school of Bec
was firmly attached to the doctrine of papal sovereignty, he
still assisted William in maintaining the independence of the
English Church; and appears at one time to have favoured
the idea of maintaining a neutral attitude on the subject of the
quarrels between papacy and empire. In the domestic affairs
of England the archbishop showed more spiritual zeal. His
grand aim was to extricate the Church from the fetters of the
state and of secular interests. He was a generous patron of
monasticism. He endeavoured to enforce celibacy upon the
secular clergy. He obtained the king&rsquo;s permission to deal with
the affairs of the Church in synods which met apart from the
Great Council, and were exclusively composed of ecclesiastics.
Nor can we doubt that it was his influence which shaped the
famous ordinance separating the ecclesiastical from the secular
courts (<i>c.</i> 1076). But even in such questions he allowed some
weight to political considerations and the wishes of his sovereign.
He acknowledged the royal right to veto the legislation of national
synods. In the cases of Odo of Bayeux (1082) and of William
of St Calais, bishop of Durham (1088), he used his legal ingenuity
to justify the trial of bishops before a lay tribunal. He accelerated
the process of substituting Normans for Englishmen in
all preferments of importance; and although his nominees were
usually respectable, it cannot be said that all of them were
better than the men whom they superseded. For this admixture
of secular with spiritual aims there was considerable excuse.
By long tradition the primate was entitled to a leading position
in the king&rsquo;s councils; and the interests of the Church demanded
that Lanfranc should use his power in a manner not displeasing
to the king. On several occasions when William I. was absent
from England Lanfranc acted as his vicegerent; he then had
opportunities of realizing the close connexion between religious
and secular affairs.</p>

<p>Lanfranc&rsquo;s greatest political service to the Conqueror was
rendered in 1075, when he detected and foiled the conspiracy
which had been formed by the earls of Norfolk and Hereford.
But this was not the only occasion on which he turned to good
account his influence with the native English. Although he
regarded them as an inferior race he was just and honourable
towards their leaders. He interceded for Waltheof&rsquo;s life and to
the last spoke of the earl as an innocent sufferer for the crimes
of others; he lived on terms of friendship with Bishop Wulfstan.
On the death of the Conqueror (1087) he secured the succession
for William Rufus, in spite of the discontent of the Anglo-Norman
baronage; and in 1088 his exhortations induced the English
militia to fight on the side of the new sovereign against Odo of
Bayeux and the other partisans of Duke Robert. He exacted
promises of just government from Rufus, and was not afraid
to remonstrate when the promises were disregarded. So long
as he lived he was a check upon the worst propensities of the
king&rsquo;s administration. But his restraining hand was too soon
removed. In 1089 he was stricken with fever and he died on
the 24th of May amidst universal lamentations. Notwithstanding
some obvious moral and intellectual defects, he was the most
eminent and the most disinterested of those who had co-operated
with William I. in riveting Norman rule upon the English
Church and people. As a statesman he did something to uphold
the traditional ideal of his office; as a primate he elevated the
standards of clerical discipline and education. Conceived in the
Hildebrandine spirit, his reforms led by a natural sequence to
strained relations between Church and State; the equilibrium
which he established was unstable, and depended too much upon
his personal influence with the Conqueror. But of all the
Hildebrandine statesmen who applied their teacher&rsquo;s ideas
within the sphere of a particular national church he was the
most successful.</p>

politician, was born at Chambéry (Savoie) on the 26th of October
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>171</span>
1828. His father had been one of Napoleon&rsquo;s officers. The son
studied philosophy and history in Paris and wrote historical
works of an anti-clerical and rationalizing tendency. These
included <i>L&rsquo;Église et les philosophes au XVIII<span class="sp">e</span> siècle</i> (1855; new
edition, with a notice of the author by E. de Pressensé, 1879);
<i>Essai sur la révolution française</i> (1858); <i>Histoire politique des
papes</i> (1860); <i>Lettres d Evérard</i> (1860), a novel in the form of
letters; <i>Le Rétablissement de la Pologne</i> (1863). His <i>magnum opus</i>
was his <i>Histoire de Napoléon I<span class="sp">er</span></i> (5 vols., 1867-1875 and 1886;
Eng. trans., 4 vols., 1871-1879), which ceased unfortunately at
the end of 1811 with the preparations for the Russian campaign
of 1812. This book, based on the emperor&rsquo;s correspondence
published in 1858-1870, attempted the destruction of the legends
which had grown up around his subject, and sought by a critical
examination of the documents to explain the motives of his
policy. In his desire to controvert current misconceptions
and exaggerations of Napoleon&rsquo;s abilities Lanfrey unduly
minimized his military and administrative genius. A stanch
republican, he was elected to the National Assembly in 1871,
became ambassador at Bern (1871-1873), and life senator in
1875. He died at Pau on the 15th of November 1877.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANG, ANDREW<a name="ar74" id="ar74"></a></span> (1844-&emsp;&emsp;), British man of letters, was
born on the 31st of March 1844, at Selkirk, Scotland. He was
educated at the Edinburgh Academy, St Andrews University
and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he took a first class in the
final classical schools in 1868, becoming a fellow and subsequently
honorary fellow of Merton College. As a journalist,
poet, critic and historian, he soon made a reputation as one of
the ablest and most versatile writers of the day. His first
publication was a volume of metrical experiments, <i>The Ballads
and Lyrics of Old France</i> (1872), and this was followed at intervals
by other volumes of dainty verse, <i>xxii.</i> <i>Ballades in Blue China</i>
(1880, enlarged edition, 1888), <i>Ballads and Verses Vain</i> (1884),
selected by Mr Austin Dobson; <i>Rhymes à la Mode</i> (1884), <i>Grass
of Parnassus</i> (1888), <i>Ban and Arrière Ban</i> (1894), <i>New Collected
Rhymes</i> (1905). He collaborated with S. H. Butcher in a prose
translation (1879) of the <i>Odyssey</i>, and with E. Myers and Walter
Leaf in a prose version (1883) of the <i>Iliad</i>, both of them remarkable
for accurate scholarship and excellence of style. As a
Homeric scholar, of conservative views, he took a high rank. His
<i>Homer and the Epic</i> appeared in 1893; a new prose translation of
<i>The Homeric Hymns</i> in 1899, with essays literary and mythological,
in which parallels to the Greek myths are given from the
traditions of savage races; and his <i>Homer and his Age</i> in 1906.
His purely journalistic activity was from the first of a varied
description, ranging from sparkling &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; for the <i>Daily
News</i> to miscellaneous articles for the <i>Morning Post</i>, and for
many years he was literary editor of <i>Longman&rsquo;s Magazine</i>;
no critic was in more request, whether for occasional articles
and introductions to new editions or as editor of dainty reprints.
To the study of Scottish history Mr Lang brought a scholarly
care for detail, a piquant literary style, and a gift for disentangling
complicated questions. The <i>Mystery of Mary Stuart</i> (1901,
new and revised ed., 1904) was a consideration of the fresh light
thrown on Mary&rsquo;s history by the Lennox MSS. in the University
library, Cambridge, strengthening her case by restating the
perfidy of her accusers. He also wrote monographs on <i>The
Portraits and Jewels of Mary Stuart</i> (1906) and <i>James VI. and
the Gowrie Mystery</i> (1902). The somewhat unfavourable view of
John Knox presented in his book <i>John Knox and the Reformation</i>
(1905) aroused considerable controversy. He gave new information
about the continental career of the Young Pretender in
<i>Pickle the Spy</i> (1897), an account of Alastair Ruadh Macdonell,
whom he identified with Pickle, a notorious Hanoverian spy.
This was followed in 1898 by <i>The Companions of Pickle</i>, and in
1900 by a monograph on <i>Prince Charles Edward</i>. In 1900 he
began a <i>History of Scotland from the Roman Occupation</i>, the
fourth volume of which (1907) brought Scottish history down
to 1746. <i>The Valet&rsquo;s Tragedy</i> (1903), which takes its title from an
essay on the &ldquo;Man with the Iron Mask,&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Iron Mask</a></span>), collects
twelve papers on historical mysteries, and <i>A Monk of Fife</i>
(1896) is a fictitious narrative purporting to be written by
a young Scot in France in 1429-1431. Mr Lang&rsquo;s versatility
was also shown in his valuable works on folk-lore and on primitive
religion. The earliest of these works was <i>Custom and Myth</i>
(1884); in <i>Myth, Literature and Religion</i> (2 vols., 1887, French
trans., 1896) he explained the irrational elements of mythology
as survivals from earlier savagery; in <i>The Making of Religion</i>
(an idealization of savage animism) he maintained the existence
of high spiritual ideas among savage races, and instituted
comparisons between savage practices and the occult phenomena
among civilized races; he dealt with the origins of totemism (<i>q.v.</i>)
in <i>Social Origins</i>, printed (1903) together with J. J. Atkinson&rsquo;s
<i>Primal Law</i>. He was one of the founders of the study of
&ldquo;Psychical Research,&rdquo; and his other writings on anthropology
include <i>The Book of Dreams and Ghosts</i> (1897), <i>Magic and Religion</i>
(1901) and <i>The Secret of the Totem</i> (1905). He carried the
humour and sub-acidity of discrimination which marked his
criticism of fellow folk-lorists into the discussion of purely
literary subjects in his <i>Books and Bookmen</i> (1886), <i>Letters to
Dead Authors</i> (1886), <i>Letters on Literature</i> (1889), &amp;c. His <i>Blue
Fairy Tale Book</i> (1889), beautifully produced and illustrated,
was followed annually at Christmas by a book of fairy tales and
romances drawn from many sources. He edited <i>The Poems and
Songs of Robert Burns</i> (1896), and was responsible for the <i>Life
and Letters</i> (1897) of J. G. Lockhart, and <i>The Life, Letters and
Diaries</i> (1890) of Sir Stafford Northcote, first earl of Iddesleigh.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LANG, KARL HEINRICH<a name="ar75" id="ar75"></a></span>, <span class="sc">Ritter von</span> (1764-1835), German
historian, was born on the 7th of June 1764 at Balgheim, near
Nördlingen. From the first he was greatly attracted towards
historical studies, and this was shown when he began to attend
the gymnasium of Oettingen, and in 1782, when he went to the
university of Altdorf, near Nuremberg. At the same time he
studied jurisprudence, and in 1782 became a government clerk
at Oettingen. About the same period began his activities as a
journalist and publicist. But Lang did not long remain an
official. He was of a restless, changeable character, which
constantly involved him in personal quarrels, though he was
equally quick to retire from them. In 1788 he obtained a
position as private tutor in Hungary, and in 1789 became private
secretary to Baron von Bühler, the envoy of Württemberg at
Vienna. This led to further travels and to his entering the
service of the prince of Oettingen-Wallerstein. In 1792 Lang
again betook himself to a university, this time to Göttingen.
Here he came under the influence of the historian, Ludwig
Timotheus Spittler, from whom, as also from Johannes von
Müller and Friedrich Schlegel, his historical studies received a
fresh impulse. At intervals from 1793 to 1801 Lang was closely
connected with the Prussian statesman Hardenberg, who
employed him as his private secretary and archivist, and in
1797 he was present with Hardenberg at the congress of Rastadt
as secretary to the legation. He was occupied chiefly with
affairs of the principalities of Anspach and Bayreuth, newly
acquired by Prussia, and especially in the settlement of disputes
with Bavaria as to their boundaries.</p>

<p>When in 1805 the principalities became part of Bavaria,
Lang entered the Bavarian service (1806), was ennobled in
1808 and from 1810 to 1817 held the office of archivist in Munich.
He again devoted himself with great enthusiasm to historical
studies, which naturally dealt chiefly with Bavarian history.
He evolved the theory, among other things, that the boundaries
of the old counties or <i>pagi</i> (<i>Gaue</i>) were identical with those of the
dioceses. This theory was combated in later days, and caused
great confusion in the province of historical geography. For
the rest, Lang did great service to the study of the history of
Bavaria, especially by bringing fresh material from the archives
to bear upon it. He also kept up his activity as a publicist, in
1814 defending in a detailed and somewhat biassed pamphlet
the policy of the minister Montgelas, and he undertook critical
studies in the history of the Jesuits. In 1817 Lang retired from
active life, and until his death, which took place on the 26th
of March 1835, lived chiefly in Ansbach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>172</span></p>

<p>Lang is best known through his <i>Memoiren</i>, which appeared at
Brunswick in two parts in 1842, and were republished in 1881
in a second edition. They contain much of interest for the
history of the period, but have to be used with the greatest
caution on account of their pronounced tendency to satire.
Lang&rsquo;s character, as can be gathered especially from a consideration
of his behaviour at Munich, is darkened by many shadows.
He did not scruple, for instance, to strike out of the lists of
witnesses to medieval charters, before publishing them, the
names of families which he disliked.</p>

Scotch-Irish ancestry. He studied at Phillips Exeter Academy
in 1845-1848, at Harvard College in 1848-1850 and in the
Harvard Law School in 1851-1854. He practised law in 1854-1870

<p><span class="bold">LANGDON, JOHN<a name="ar77" id="ar77"></a></span> (1741-1819), American statesman, was
born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on the 25th of June 1741.
After an apprenticeship in a counting-house, he led a seafaring
life for several years, and became a shipowner and merchant.
In December 1774, as a militia captain he assisted in the capture
of Fort William and Mary at New Castle, New Hampshire, one
of the first overt acts of the American colonists against the
property of the crown. He was elected to the House of Representatives
of the last Royal Assembly of New Hampshire and
then to the second Continental Congress in 1775, and was a
member of the first Naval Committee of the latter, but he
resigned in 1776, and in June 1776 became Congress&rsquo;s agent of
prizes in New Hampshire and in 1778 continental (naval) agent
of Congress in this state, where he supervised the building of
John Paul Jones&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ranger&rdquo; (completed in June 1777), the
&ldquo;America,&rdquo; launched in 1782, and other vessels. He was a
judge of the New Hampshire Court of Common Pleas in 1776-1777,
a member (and speaker) of the New Hampshire House of
Representatives from 1776 until 1782, a member of the state
Constitutional Convention of 1778 and of the state Senate
in 1784-1785, and in 1783-1784 was again a member of Congress.
He contributed largely to raise troops in 1777 to meet Burgoyne;
and he served as a captain at Bennington and at Saratoga. He
was president of New Hampshire in 1785-1786 and in 1788-1789;
a member of the Federal Constitutional Convention in 1787,
where he voted against granting to Congress the power of
issuing paper money; a member of the state convention which
ratified the Federal Constitution for New Hampshire; a member
of the United States Senate in 1789-1801, and its president <i>pro
tem</i>. during the first Congress and the second session of the
second Congress; a member of the New Hampshire House of
Representatives in 1801-1805 and its speaker in 1803-1805;
and governor of the state in 1805-1809 and in 1810-1812. He
received nine electoral votes for the vice-presidency in 1808,
and in 1812 was an elector on the Madison ticket. He died in
Portsmouth on the 18th of September 1819. He was an able
leader during the Revolutionary period, when his wealth and
social position were of great assistance to the patriot party.
In the later years of his life in New Hampshire he was the most
prominent of the local Republican leaders and built up his party
by partisan appointments. He refused the naval portfolio in
Jefferson&rsquo;s cabinet.</p>

<p>His elder brother, <span class="sc">Woodbury Langdon</span> (1739-1805), was a
delegate to the Continental Congress in 1779-1780, a member of
the executive council of New Hampshire in 1781-1784, judge
of the Supreme Court of the state in 1782 and in 1786-1790
(although he had had no legal training), and a state senator in
1784-1785.</p>

French actress, was born in Genoa on the 17th of September
1772, the daughter of a musician and an actress at the Comédie
Italienne. She made her first appearance on the stage at Tours
in 1787 and a successful début at the Comédie Française in 1788
in <i>L&rsquo;Écossaise</i> and <i>L&rsquo;Oracle</i>. She followed Talma and the others
in 1791 to the Rue Richelieu, but returned after a few months
to the Comédie Française. Here her talent and beauty gave
her an enormous success in François de Neuchâteau&rsquo;s <i>Pamela</i>,
the performance of which brought upon the theatre the vials
of wrath of the Committee of Safety. With the author and the
other members of the caste, she was arrested and imprisoned.
After the 9th Thermidor she rejoined her comrades at the
Feydeau, but retired on the 16th of December 1797, reappearing
only for a few performances in 1807. She had, meantime,
married the son of a rich Belgian named Simons. She died on

<p><span class="bold">LANGE, ERNST PHILIPP KARL<a name="ar79" id="ar79"></a></span> (1813-1899), German
novelist, who wrote under the pseudonym <i>Philipp Galen</i>, was
born at Potsdam on the 21st of December 1813. He studied
medicine at Berlin (1835-1840), and on taking his degree, in
1840, entered the Prussian army as surgeon. In this capacity
he saw service in the Schleswig-Holstein campaign of 1849.
He settled at Bielefeld as medical practitioner and here issued
his first novel, <i>Der Inselkönig</i> (1852, 3rd ed., 1858), which enjoyed
considerable popularity. In Bielefeld he continued to work at
his profession and to write, until his retirement, with the rank
of <i>Oberstabsarzt</i> (surgeon-general) to Potsdam in 1878; there
he died on the 20th of February 1899. Lange&rsquo;s novels are
distinguished by local colouring and pretty, though not powerful,
descriptions of manners and customs. He particularly favoured
scenes of English life, though he had never been in that country,
and on the whole he succeeded well in his descriptions. Chief
among his novels are, <i>Der Irre von St James</i> (1853, 5th ed.,
1871), and <i>Emery Glandon</i> (3rd ed., Leip., 1865), while of those
dealing with the Schleswig-Holstein campaign <i>Andreas Burns</i>
(1856) and <i>Die Tochter des Diplomaten</i> (1865) commanded
considerable attention.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANGE, FRIEDRICH ALBERT<a name="ar80" id="ar80"></a></span> (1828-1875), German philosopher
and sociologist, was born on the 28th of September
1828, at Wald, near Solingen, the son of the theologian, J. P.
Lange (<i>q.v.</i>). He was educated at Duisburg, Zürich and Bonn,
where he distinguished himself by gymnastics as much as by
study. In 1852 he became schoolmaster at Cologne; in 1855
<i>privatdozent</i> in philosophy at Bonn; in 1858 schoolmaster
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>173</span>
at Duisburg, resigning when the government forbade schoolmasters
to take part in political agitation. Lange then entered
on a career of militant journalism in the cause of political and
social reform. He was also prominent in the affairs of his town,
yet found leisure to write most of his best-known books, <i>Die
Leibesübungen</i> (1863), <i>Die Arbeiterfrage</i> (1865, 5th ed. 1894),
<i>Geschichte des Materialismus und Kritik seiner Bedeutung in
der Gegenwart</i> (1866; 7th ed. with biographical sketch by H.
Cohen, 1902; Eng. trans., E. C. Thomas, 1877), and <i>J. S.
Mill&rsquo;s Ansichten über die sociale Frage</i> (1866). In 1866, discouraged
by affairs in Germany, he moved to Winterthur,
near Zürich, to become connected with the democratic newspaper,
<i>Winterthurer Landbote</i>. In 1869 he was <i>Privatdozent at Zürich</i>,
and next year professor. The strong French sympathies of the
Swiss in the Franco-German War led to his speedy resignation.
Thenceforward he gave up politics. In 1872 he accepted a
professorship at Marburg. Unhappily, his vigorous frame was
already stricken with disease, and, after a lingering illness, he
died at Marburg, on the 23rd of November 1875, diligent to the
end. His <i>Logische Studien</i> was published by H. Cohen in 1877
(2nd ed., 1894). His main work, the <i>Geschichte des Materialismus</i>,
which is brilliantly written, with wide scientific knowledge and
more sympathy with English thought than is usual in Germany,
is rather a didactic exposition of principles than a history in
the proper sense. Adopting the Kantian standpoint that we
can know nothing but phenomena, Lange maintains that neither
materialism nor any other metaphysical system has a valid
claim to ultimate truth. For empirical phenomenal knowledge,
however, which is all that man can look for, materialism with
its exact scientific methods has done most valuable service.
Ideal metaphysics, though they fail of the inner truth of things,
have a value as the embodiment of high aspirations, in the same
way as poetry and religion. In Lange&rsquo;s <i>Logische Studien</i>, which
attempts a reconstruction of formal logic, the leading idea is
that reasoning has validity in so far as it can be represented in
terms of space. His <i>Arbeiterfrage</i> advocates an ill-defined form
of socialism. It protests against contemporary industrial
selfishness, and against the organization of industry on the
Darwinian principle of struggle for existence.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANGE, JOHANN PETER<a name="ar81" id="ar81"></a></span> (1802-1884), German Protestant
theologian, was of peasant origin and was born at Sonneborn
near Elberfeld on the 10th of April 1802. He studied theology
at Bonn (from 1822) under K. I. Nitzsch and G. C. F. Lücke,
held several pastorates, and eventually (1854) settled at Bonn
as professor of theology in succession to Isaac A. Dorner,
becoming also in 1860 counsellor to the consistory. He died on
the 9th of July 1884. Lange has been called the poetical
theologian <i>par excellence</i>: &ldquo;It has been said of him that his
thoughts succeed each other in such rapid and agitated waves
that all calm reflection and all rational distinction become,
in a manner, drowned&rdquo; (F. Lichtenberger). As a dogmatic
writer he belonged to the school of Schleiermacher. His <i>Christliche
Dogmatik</i> (3 vols., 1849-1852, new edition, 1870) &ldquo;contains
many fruitful and suggestive thoughts, which, however, are
hidden under such a mass of bold figures and strange fancies,
and suffer so much from want of clearness of presentation,
that they did not produce any lasting effect&rdquo; (Otto Pfleiderer).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His other works include <i>Das Leben Jesu</i> (3 vols., 1844-1847), <i>Das
apostolische Zeitalter</i> (2 vols., 1853-1854). <i>Grundriss der theologischen

<i>Grundriss der Bibelkunde</i> (1881). In 1857 he undertook with other
scholars a <i>Theologisch-homiletisches Bibelwerk</i>, to which he contributed
commentaries on the first four books of the Pentateuch, Haggai,
Zechariah, Malachi, Matthew, Mark, Revelation. The <i>Bibelwerk</i>

<p><span class="bold">LANGEN, JOSEPH<a name="ar83" id="ar83"></a></span> (1837-1901), German theologian, was born
at Cologne on the 3rd of June 1837. He studied at Bonn, was
ordained priest in 1859, was nominated professor extraordinary
at the university of Bonn in 1864, and a professor in ordinary
of the exegesis of the New Testament in 1867&mdash;an office which
he held till his death. He was one of the able band of professors
who in 1870 supported Döllinger in his resistance to the Vatican
decrees, and was excommunicated with Ignaz v. Döllinger,
Johann Huber, Johann Friedrich, Franz Heinrich Reusch,
Joseph Hubert Reinkens and others, for refusing to accept them.
In 1878, in consequence of the permission given to priests to
marry, he ceased to identify himself with the Old Catholic
movement, although he was not reconciled with the Roman
Catholic Church. Langen was more celebrated as a writer than
as a speaker. His first work was an inquiry into the authorship
of the Commentary on St Paul&rsquo;s Epistles and the Treatise
on Biblical Questions, ascribed to Ambrose and Augustine respectively.
In 1868 he published an <i>Introduction to the New
Testament</i>, a work of which a second edition was called for in
1873. He also published works on the <i>Last Days of the Life
of Jesus</i>, on <i>Judaism in the Time of Christ</i>, on <i>John of Damascus</i>
(1879) and an <i>Examination of the Vatican Dogma in the Light
of Patristic Exegesis of the New Testament</i>. But he is chiefly
famous for his <i>History of the Church of Rome to the Pontificate
of Innocent III.</i> (4 vols., 1881-1893), a work of sound scholarship,
based directly upon the authorities, the most important sources
being woven carefully into the text. He also contributed largely
to the <i>Internationale theologische Zeitschrift</i>, a review started
in 1893 by the Old Catholics to promote the union of National
Churches on the basis of the councils of the Undivided Church,
and admitting articles in German, French and English. Among
other subjects, he wrote on the School of Hierotheus, on Romish
falsifications of the Greek Fathers, on Leo XIII., on Liberal
Ultramontanism, on the Papal Teaching in regard to Morals,
on Vincentius of Lerins and he carried on a controversy with
Professor Willibald Beyschlag, of the German Evangelical
Church, on the respective merits of Protestantism and Old
Catholicism regarded as a basis for teaching the Christian faith.
An attack of apoplexy put an end to his activity as a teacher and
hastened his death, which occurred in July 1901.</p>

German surgeon, was born at Horneburg on the 9th of
November 1810, and received his medical education at Göttingen,
where he took his doctor&rsquo;s degree in 1835 with a thesis on the
structure of the retina. After a visit to France and England, he
returned to Göttingen as <i>Privatdozent</i>, and in 1842 became
professor of surgery and director of the Friedrichs Hospital at
Kiel. Six years later he succeeded J. F. Dieffenbach (1794-1847)
as director of the Clinical Institute for Surgery and Ophthalmology
at Berlin, and remained there till 1882, when failing
health obliged him to retire. He died at Wiesbaden on the 30th
of September 1887. Langenbeck was a bold and skilful operator,
but was disinclined to resort to operation while other means
afforded a prospect of success. He devoted particular attention
to military surgery, and was a great authority in the treatment
of gunshot wounds. Besides acting as general field-surgeon of
the army in the war with Denmark in 1848, he saw active service
in 1864, 1866, and again in the Franco-German campaign of
1870-71. He was in Orleans at the end of 1870, after the city
had been taken by the Prussians, and was unwearied in his
attentions, whether as operator or consultant, to wounded men
with whom every public building was packed. He also utilized
the opportunities for instruction that thus arose, and the
&ldquo;Militär-Aerztliche Gesellschaft,&rdquo; which met twice a week for
some months, and in the discussions of which every surgeon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>174</span>

Near it are the remains of the old Benedictine monastery of
Homburg or Hohenburg, where the emperor Henry IV. defeated
the Saxons in 1075. The manufacture of cloth is the chief
industry; lace, starch, machines, cigars and chemicals are also
produced, while spinning, dyeing, brewing and printing are
carried on. There is a sulphur bath in the neighbourhood,
situated in a pleasant park, in which there are monuments to
those who fell in the war of 1866. Langensalza became a town
in 1211 and was afterwards part of the electorate of Saxony.
In 1815 it came into the possession of Prussia. It is remarkable
in history as the scene of three battles: (1) the victory of the
Prussians and English over the imperial army on the 15th of
February 1761; (2) that of the Prussians over the Bavarians
on the 17th of April 1813; and (3) the engagement on the 27th
of June 1866 between the Prussians and the Hanoverians, in
which the latter, though victorious in the field, were compelled
to lay down their arms on the arrival of overwhelming Prussian
reinforcements.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANGHAM, SIMON<a name="ar86" id="ar86"></a></span> (d. 1376), archbishop of Canterbury and
cardinal, was born at Langham in Rutland, becoming a monk
in the abbey of St Peter at Westminster, and later prior and then
abbot of this house. In 1360 he was made treasurer of England
and in 1361 he became bishop of Ely; he was appointed chancellor
of England in 1363 and was chosen archbishop of Canterbury
in 1366. Perhaps the most interesting incident in his
primacy was when he drove the secular clergy from their college
of Canterbury Hall, Oxford, and filled their places with monks.
The expelled head of the seculars was a certain John de Wiclif,
who has been identified with the great reformer Wycliffe. Notwithstanding
the part Langham as chancellor had taken in the
anti-papal measures of 1365 and 1366 he was made a cardinal
by Pope Urban V. in 1368. This step lost him the favour of
Edward III., and two months later he resigned his archbishopric
and went to Avignon. He was soon allowed to hold other
although less exalted positions in England, and in 1374 he was
elected archbishop of Canterbury for the second time; but he
withdrew his claim and died at Avignon on the 22nd of July
1376. Langham&rsquo;s tomb is the oldest monument to an ecclesiastic
in Westminster Abbey; he left the residue of his estate&mdash;a large
sum of money&mdash;to the abbey, and has been called its second
founder.</p>

uniting the old town on the left bank with the new on the right,

the Telford library, and the Hope hospital for aged poor. Already
famous for its plaids and blankets, the prosperity of the burgh
advanced when it took up the manufacture of tweeds. Distilling,
brewing, dyeing and tanning are also important industries. The
Esk and Liddel being favourite fishing streams, Langholm is the

of Blagdon, Somerset, where he died on the 1st of April 1779.
His poems (original and translations), and sentimental tales, are
now forgotten, but his translation of Plutarch&rsquo;s <i>Lives</i> (1770), in
which he had the co-operation of his elder brother William
(1721-1772), is not yet superseded. It is far less vigorous than
Sir Thomas North&rsquo;s version (translated from Amyot) but is free
from its inaccuracies. His poems were published in 1804 by his
son, J. T. Langhorne, with a memoir of the author; they will
also be found in R. Anderson&rsquo;s <i>Poets of Great Britain</i>, xi. (1794)

born at Krotoszyn, in the province of Posen, on the 5th of August
1827, his father being the local doctor. Langiewicz was educated
at Posen, Breslau and Prague, and was compelled to earn his
daily bread by giving lectures. He subsequently entered the
Prussian <i>Landwehr</i> and served for a year in the royal guard.
In 1860 he migrated to Paris and was for a time professor in the
high school founded there by Mieroslawski. The same year he
took part in Garibaldi&rsquo;s Neapolitan campaign, and was then a
professor in the military school at Cuneo till the establishment
was closed. In 1862 he entered into communication with the
central Polish committee at Warsaw, and on the outbreak of the
insurrection of the 22nd of January 1863, took the command of
the armed bands. He defeated the Russians at Wachock and
Slupia (February), capturing 1000 muskets and 8 cannon. This
victory drew hundreds of young recruits to his standard, till
at last he had 12,000 men at his disposal. On the 23rd of
February he again defeated the Russians, at Malogoszcza, and
captured 500 muskets and 2 cannon. On the 10th of March
he proclaimed himself dictator and attempted to form a regular
government; but either he had insufficient organizing talent,
or had not time enough to carry out his plans, and after a fresh
series of engagements his army was almost annihilated at Zagosc
(18th of March), whereupon he took refuge in Austrian territory
and was interned at Tarnow. He was subsequently transferred
to the fortress of Josephstadt, from which he was released in
1865. He then lived at Solothurn as a citizen of the Swiss
Republic, and subsequently entered the Turkish service as Langie

<p><span class="bold">LANGLAND, WILLIAM<a name="ar90" id="ar90"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1332-<i>c.</i> 1400), the supposed
English poet, generally regarded until recently as the single
author of the remarkable 14th-century poem <i>Piers the Plowman</i>.
Its full title is&mdash;<i>The Vision of William concerning Piers the
Plowman, together with Vita de Do-wel, Do-bet, et Do-best, secundum
Wit et Resoun</i>; usually given in Latin as <i>Visio Willelmi de
Petra Plowman, &amp;c.</i>; the whole work being sometimes briefly
described as <i>Liber de Petro Plowman</i>. We know nothing of
William Langland except from the supposed evidence of the MSS.
of the poem and the text itself, and it will be convenient first
to give a brief general description of them.</p>

<p>The poem exists in three forms. If we denote these by the
names of A-text (or Vernon), B-text (or Crowley), and C-text
(or Whitaker), we find, of the first, ten MSS., of the second
fourteen, and of the third seventeen, besides seven others of a
mixed type. It will be seen that we thus have abundance of
material, a circumstance which proves the great popularity of the
poem in former times. Owing to the frequent expressions which
indicate a desire for reformation in religion, it was, in the time of
Edward VI., considered worthy of being printed. Three impressions
of the B-text were printed by Robert Crowley in 1550;
and one of these was badly reprinted by Owen Rogers in 1561.
In 1813 the best MS. of the C-text was printed by Dr E. Whitaker.
In 1842 Mr Thomas Wright printed an edition from an excellent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>175</span>
MS. of the B-text in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge
(2nd ed., 1856, new ed., 1895). A complete edition of all
three texts was printed for the Early English Text Society as
edited by the Rev. W. W. Skeat, with the addition of <i>Richard
the Redeless</i>, and containing full notes to all three texts, with a
glossary and indexes, in 1867-1885. The Clarendon Press
edition, by the same editor, appeared in 1886.</p>

<p>The A-text contains a prologue and 12 passus or cantos (i.-iv.,
the vision of the Lady Meed; v.-viii., the vision of Piers the
Plowman; ix.-xii., the vision of Do-wel, Do-bet and Do-best),
with 2567 lines. The B-text is much longer, containing 7242
lines, with additional passus following after xi. of A, the earlier
passus being altered in various respects. The C-text, with 7357
lines, is a revision of B.</p>

<p>The general contents of the poem may be gathered from a
brief description of the C-text. This is divided into twenty-three
passus, nominally comprising four parts, called respectively
Visio de Petro Plowman, Visio de Do-wel, Visio de Do-bet and
Visio de Do-best. Here <i>Do-bet</i> signifies &ldquo;do better&rdquo; in modern
English; the explanation of the names being that he who does
a kind action <i>does well</i>, he who teaches others to act kindly <i>does
better</i>, whilst he who combines both practice and theory, both
doing good himself and teaching others to do the same, <i>does best</i>.
But the visions by no means closely correspond to these descriptions;
and Skeat divides the whole into a set of eleven visions,
which may be thus enumerated: (1) Vision of the Field Full of
Folk, of Holy Church, and of the Lady Meed (passus i.-v.);
(2) Vision of the Seven Deadly Sins, and of Piers the Plowman
(pass. vi.-x.); (3) Wit, Study, Clergy and Scripture (pass. xi.,
xii.); (4) Fortune, Nature, Recklessness and Reason (pass.
xiii., xiv.); (5) Vision of Imaginative (pass. xv.); (6) Conscience,
Patience and Activa-Vita (pass. xvi., xvii.); (7) Free-will and
the Tree of Charity (pass. xviii., xix.); (8) Faith, Hope and
Charity (pass. xx.); (9) The Triumph of Piers the Plowman,
<i>i.e.</i> the Crucifixion, Burial and Resurrection of Jesus Christ
(pass. xxi.); (10) The Vision of Grace (pass. xxii.); (11) The
Vision of Antichrist (pass. xxiii.).</p>

<p>The bare outline of the C-text gives little idea of the real
nature of the poem. The author&rsquo;s object, as Skeat describes it,
was to &ldquo;afford himself opportunities (of which he has amply
availed himself) for describing the life and manners of the poorer
classes; for inveighing against clerical abuses and the rapacity
of the friars; for representing the miseries caused by the great
pestilences then prevalent and by the hasty and ill-advised
marriages consequent thereupon; and for denouncing lazy
workmen and sham beggars, the corruption and bribery then
too common in the law courts, and all the numerous forms of
falsehood which are at all time the fit subjects for satire and
indignant exposure. In describing, for example, the seven
deadly sins, he gives so exact a description of Glutton and Sloth
that the reader feels them to be no mere abstractions, but drawn
from the life; and it becomes hardly more difficult to realize
Glutton than it is to realize Sir John Falstaff. The numerous
allegorical personages so frequently introduced, such as Scripture,
Clergy, Conscience, Patience and the like, are all mouthpieces
of the author himself, uttering for the most part his own sentiments,
but sometimes speaking in accordance with the character
which each is supposed to represent. The theological disquisitions
which are occasionally introduced are somewhat dull and
tedious, but the earnestness of the author&rsquo;s purpose and his
energy of language tend to relieve them, and there are not many
passages which might have been omitted without loss. The
poem is essentially one of those which improve on a second
reading, and as a linguistic monument it is of very high value.
Mere extracts from the poem, even if rather numerous and of
some length, fail to give a fair idea of it. The whole deserves,
and will repay, a careful study; indeed, there are not many
single works from which a student of English literature and of
the English language may derive more substantial benefit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The metre is alliterative, and destitute of final rhyme. It is
not very regular, as the author&rsquo;s earnestness led him to use the
fittest words rather than those which merely served the purpose
of rhythm. The chief rule is that, in general, the same letter
or combination of letters should begin <i>three</i> stressed syllables
in the same line, as, for example, in the line which may be
modernized thus: &lsquo;Of all <i>m</i>anner of <i>m</i>en, the <i>m</i>ean and the
rich.&rsquo; Sometimes there are but <i>two</i> such rhyme-letters, as:
&lsquo;<i>M</i>ight of the commons <i>m</i>ade him to reign.&rsquo; Sometimes there
are <i>four</i>, as: &lsquo;In a summer season, when soft was the sun.&rsquo;
There is invariably a pause, more or less distinct, in the middle
of each line&rdquo; (<i>Ency. Brit.</i>, 9th ed., art. <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Langland</a></span>).</p>

<p>The traditional view, accepted by such great authorities as
Skeat and Jusserand, that a single author&mdash;and that author
Langland&mdash;was responsible for the whole poem, in all its
versions, has been so recently disputed that it seems best to
state it in Skeat&rsquo;s own words, before giving briefly the alternative
view, which propounds a theory of composite authorship, denying
any real existence to &ldquo;William Langland.&rdquo; The account of the
single-author theory is repeated from Professor Skeat&rsquo;s article
in the 9th edition of this work, slightly revised by him in 1905
for this edition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The author&rsquo;s name is not quite certain, and the facts concerning
his life are few and scanty. As to his Christian name we are
sure, from various allusions in the poem itself, and the title
<i>Visio Willelmi</i>, &amp;c., in many MSS.; so that we may at once
reject the suggestion that his name may have been Robert.
In no less than three MSS. [of the C-text; one not later than
1427] occurs the following colophon: &lsquo;Explicit visio Willelmi
W. de Petro le Plowman.&rsquo; What is here meant by W. it is
difficult to conjecture; but it is just possible that it may represent
Wychwood (of which more presently), or Wigornensis, <i>i.e.</i>
of Worcester. As to the surname, we find the note that &lsquo;Robert
or William Langland made pers ploughman,&rsquo; in a handwriting
of the 15th century, on the fly-leaf of a MS. copy [of the B-text]
formerly belonging to Lord Ashburnham, and now in the British
Museum; and in a Dublin MS. [of the C-text] is the note [in a
15th-century hand]: &lsquo;Memorandum, quod Stacy de Rokayle,
pater Willielmi de Langlond, qui Stacius fuit generosus et
morabatur in Schiptone-under-Whicwode, tenens domini le
Spenser in comitatu Oxon., qui predictus Willielmus fecit librum
qui vocatur Perys Ploughman.&rsquo; There is no trace of any
Langland family in the midland counties, while the Langley
family were wardens of Wychwood forest in Oxfordshire between
the years 1278 and 1362; but this consideration can hardly
set aside the above statement. According to Bale, our author
was born at Cleobury Mortimer, which is quite consistent with
the supposition that his father may have removed from that
place to Shipton in Oxfordshire, as there seems to have been a
real connexion between the families in those places.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The internal evidence concerning the author is fuller and
more satisfactory. By piecing together the various hints
concerning himself which the poet gives us, we may compile
the following account. His name was William (and probably
Langland), and he was born about 1332, perhaps at Cleobury
Mortimer in Shropshire. His father, who was doubtless a franklin
or farmer, and his other friends put him to school, made a
&lsquo;clerk&rsquo; or scholar of him, and taught him what Holy Writ
meant. In 1362, at the age of about thirty, he found himself
wandering upon the Malvern hills, and fell asleep beside a stream,
and saw in a vision a field full of folk, <i>i.e.</i> this present world,
and many other remarkable sights which he duly records. From
this supposed circumstance he named his poem <i>The Vision
of William</i>, though it is really a succession of visions, since
he mentions several occasions on which he awoke, and afterwards
again fell asleep; and he even tells us of some adventures which
befel him in his waking moments. In some of these visions there
is no mention of Piers the Plowman, but in others he describes
him as being the coming reformer who was to remedy all abuses,
and restore the world to a right condition. It is remarkable that
his conception of this reformer changes from time to time, and
becomes more exalted as the poem advances. At first he is no
more than a ploughman, one of the true and honest labourers
who are the salt of the earth; but at last he is identified with
the great reformer who has come already, the regenerator of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>176</span>
world in the person of Jesus Christ; in the author&rsquo;s own phrase&mdash;&rsquo;Petrus
est Christus.&rsquo; If this be borne in mind, it will not be
possible to make the mistake into which so many have fallen,
of speaking of Piers the Plowman as being the author, not the
subject, of the poem. The author once alludes to the nickname
of Long Will bestowed upon him from his tallness of stature&mdash;just
as the poet Gascoigne was familiarly called Long George.
Though there is mention of the Malvern hills more than once near
the beginning of the poem, it is abundantly clear that the poet
lived for &lsquo;many years in Cornhill (London), with his wife Kitte
and his daughter Calote.&rsquo; He seems to have come to London
soon after the date of the first commencement of his work, and
to have long continued there. He describes himself as being
a tall man, one who was loath to reverence lords or ladies or
persons in gay apparel, and not deigning to say &lsquo;God save you&rsquo;
to the sergeants whom he met in the street, insomuch that many
people took him to be a fool. He was very poor, wore long robes,
and had a shaven crown, having received the clerical tonsure.
But he seems only to have taken minor orders, and earned a
precarious living by singing the <i>placebo</i>, <i>dirige</i> and seven psalms
for the good of men&rsquo;s souls. The fact that he was married may
explain why he never rose in the church. But he had another
source of livelihood in his ability to write out legal documents,
and he was extremely familiar with the law courts at Westminster.
His leisure time must have been entirely occupied with his
poem, which was essentially the work of his lifetime. He was
not satisfied with rewriting it once, but he actually re-wrote it
twice; and from the abundance of the MSS. which still exist
we can see its development from the earliest draught (A-text),
written about 1362, to its latest form (C-text), written about
1393.<a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>&ldquo;In 1399, just before the deposition of Richard II., appeared
a poem addressed to the king, who is designated as &lsquo;Richard the
Redeless,&rsquo; <i>i.e.</i> devoid of counsel. This poem, occurring in only
one MS. [of the B-text] in which it is incomplete, breaking off
abruptly in the middle of a page, may safely be attributed to
Langland, who was then in Bristol. As he was at that time
about sixty-seven years of age, we may be sure that he did not
long survive the accession of Henry IV. It may here be observed
that the well-known poem, entitled <i>Pierce Ploughman&rsquo;s Crede</i>,
though excellently written, is certainly an imitation by another
hand; for the Pierce Ploughman of the <i>Crede</i> is very different
in conception from the subject of &lsquo;William&rsquo;s Vision.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the other hand, the view taken by Professor J. M. Manly,
of Chicago, which has recently obtained increasing acceptance
among scholars, is that the early popularity of the <i>Piers Plowman</i>
poems has resulted in &ldquo;the confusion of what is really the work
of five different men,&rdquo; and that Langland himself is &ldquo;a mythical
author.&rdquo; The argument for the distinction in authorship rests
on internal evidence, and on analysis of the style, diction and
&ldquo;visualizing&rdquo; quality within the different texts. Whereas
Skeat, regarding the three texts as due to the same author,
gives most attention to the later versions, and considers B
the intermediate form, as on the whole the best, Manly recognizes
in A the real poet, and lays special stress on the importance
of attention to the A-text, and particularly pass. i.-viii. In
this A-text the two first visions are regarded as by a single
author of genius, but the third is assigned to a continuator
who tried to imitate him, the whole conclusion of the 12th
passus being, moreover, by a third author, whose name, John
But, is in fact given towards the end, but in a way leading Skeat
only to credit him with a few lines. The same process of analysis
leads to crediting the B-text and the C-text to separate and
different authors, B working over the three visions of the A-text
and making additions of his own, while C again worked
over the B-text. The supposed references to the original author
A, introduced by B and C, are then to be taken as part of the
fiction. Who were the five authors? That question is left
unsolved. John But, according to Professor Manly, was &ldquo;doubtless
a scribe&rdquo; or &ldquo;a minstrel.&rdquo; B, C and the continuator
of A &ldquo;seem to have been clerics, and, from their criticisms
of monks and friars, to have been of the secular clergy,&rdquo; C
being &ldquo;a better scholar than either the continuator of A or B.&rdquo;
A, who &ldquo;exempts from his satire no order of society except
monks,&rdquo; may have been himself a monk, but &ldquo;as he exhibits
no special technical knowledge or interests&rdquo; he &ldquo;may have
been a layman.&rdquo; As regards Richard the Redeless, Professor
Manly attributes this to another imitator; he regards identity
of authorship as out of the question, in consequences of differences
in style and thought, apart altogether from the conclusion as
to the authorship of <i>Piers the Plowman</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANGLEY, SAMUEL PIERPONT<a name="ar91" id="ar91"></a></span> (1834-1906), American
physicist and astronomer, was born at Roxbury, Boston,
Massachusetts, on the 22nd of August 1834. After acting
for a short time as assistant in Harvard College Observatory,
he was appointed assistant professor of mathematics in the U.S.
Naval Academy in 1866, and in the following year became director
of the Allegheny Observatory at Pittsburg, a position which he
held until his selection in 1887 as secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution at Washington. His name is especially associated
with two main branches of investigation&mdash;aeronautics, and the
exploration of the infra-red portions of the solar spectrum.
The study of the latter he took up as a result of the publication
in 1871 of an energy-curve of the spectrum by S. I. Lamansky.
The imperfections of the thermopile, with which he began his
work, led him, about 1880, to the invention of the bolometer,
an instrument of extraordinary delicacy, which in its most
refined form is believed to be capable of detecting a change of
temperature amounting to less than one-hundred-millionth of
a degree Centigrade. Depending on the fact that the electrical
conductivity of a metallic conductor is decreased by heat, it
consists of two strips of platinum, arranged to form the two arms
of a Wheatstone bridge; one strip being exposed to a source
of radiation from which the other is shielded, the heat causes
a change in the resistance of one arm, the balance of the bridge
is destroyed, and a deflection is marked on the galvanometer.
The platinum strips are exceedingly minute, being in some
cases only <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">250</span> in. in width, and less than one-tenth of that
amount in thickness. By the aid of this instrument, Langley,
working on Mount Whitney, 12,000 ft. above sea-level, discovered
in 1881 an entirely unsuspected extension of the invisible
infra-red rays, which he called the &ldquo;new spectrum.&rdquo; The
importance of his achievement may be judged from the fact
that, while the visible spectrum includes rays having wave-lengths
of from about 0.4 &mu; to 0.76 &mu;, and no invisible heat-rays were
known before 1881 having a wave-length greater than 1.8 &mu;,
he detected rays having a wave-length of 5.3 &mu;. In addition,
taking advantage of the accuracy with which the bolometer
can determine the position of a source of heat by which it is
affected, he mapped out in this infra-red spectrum over 700
dark lines or bands resembling the Fraunhofer lines of the visible
spectrum, with a probable accuracy equal to that of refined
astronomical observations. In aeronautics he succeeded in
demonstrating the practicability of mechanical flight. He first
undertook a preliminary inquiry into the principles upon which
flight depends, and established at Allegheny a huge &ldquo;whirling
table,&rdquo; the revolving arm of which could be driven by a steam-engine
at any circumferential speed up to 70 m. an hour. The
construction of a flying machine was next attempted. The
first difficulty was to make it sufficiently light in relation to
the power its machinery could develop; and several machines
were built in which trials were made of steam, and of compressed
air and carbonic acid gas as motive agents. About 1893 a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>177</span>
satisfactory machine was ready, and a new series of troubles had
to be faced, for it had to be launched at a certain initial speed,
and in the face of any wind that might be blowing. To enable
these conditions to be fulfilled, as well as to ensure that the
machine, when it fell, should fall on water, the experiments
were carried out on the Potomac river, some 30 m. below Washington.
It was not till the autumn of 1894 that an efficient launching
apparatus was devised, and then the wings were found not to be
strong enough to bear the pressures to which they were subjected.
Various other delays and mishaps followed, but ultimately, on
the 6th of May 1896, a successful flight was made. On that
day an aerodrome, weighing about 30 &#8468; and about 16 ft. in
length, with wings measuring between 12 and 13 ft. from tip
to tip, twice sustained itself in the air for 1½ minutes (the full
time for which it was supplied with fuel and water), and traversed
on each occasion a distance of over half a mile, falling gently
into the water when the engines stopped. Later in the same
year, on the 28th of November, a similar aerodrome flew about
three-quarters of a mile, attaining a speed of 30 m. an hour.
In 1903 he experimented with an aerodrome capable of carrying
a man, but repeated accidents prevented it from being launched,
and finally through lack of funds the experiments had to be
abandoned without the machine ever having been free in the
air (see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Flight And Flying</a></span>). Langley died on the 27th of
February 1906.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANGLOIS, HIPPOLYTE<a name="ar92" id="ar92"></a></span> (1839-&emsp;&emsp;), French general, was
born at Besançon in 1839, and, after passing through the École
Polytechnique, was appointed to the artillery as sub-lieutenant
in 1858, attaining the rank of captain in 1866. He served in the
army of Metz in the war of 1870. Eight years later he became
major, in 1887 lieutenant-colonel and in 1888 colonel. At this
time he was appointed professor of artillery at the École de Guerre,
and in this post he devoted himself to working out the tactical
principles of the employment of field artillery under the new
conditions of armament of which he foresaw the advent. The
public result of his work was the great treatise <i>L&rsquo;Artillerie de
campagne</i> (1891-1892), which may still be regarded as the classic
of the arm. In 1894 he became general of brigade, and in 1898
general of division. For two years after this he was the commandant
of the École de Guerre at the time that the modern
French strategical and tactical &ldquo;doctrine&rdquo; was being developed
and taught. He was, however, regarded as a leader as well as a
theorist, and in 1901 he was selected to command the XX. Army
Corps on the German frontier, popularly called the &ldquo;iron&rdquo;
corps. In 1902 he became a member of the Conseil supérieur de
la Guerre, consisting of senior generals marked out for the higher
commands in war. He retired from the active list in 1904 on
reaching the age limit, and devoted himself with the greatest
energy to critical military literature. In 1907 he began the
publication of a monthly journal of military art and history,
the <i>Revue militaire générale</i>. The most important of his other
works are <i>Enseignements de deux guerres recentes</i> and <i>Conséquences
tactiques du progrès de l&rsquo;armement</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANGPORT<a name="ar93" id="ar93"></a></span>, a market town in the eastern parliamentary
division of Somersetshire, England, 13½ m. E. of Taunton by
the Great Western railway. Pop. (1901) 890. It lies on the
right (east) bank of the river Parret, near the point where that
river debouches from the hills on to the plain through which it
flows to the Bristol Channel. The main street leads up a slope
from the river to the fine Perpendicular church of All Saints.
Close to this an archway crosses the road, bearing a Perpendicular
building known as the hanging chapel. After serving this
purpose it housed first the grammar-school (founded 1675),
then the Quekett museum, named after John Thomas Quekett
(1815-1861) the histologist, a native of the town, whose father
was master of the school. The hanging chapel afterwards became
a masonic hall. Not far distant is the church of Huish Episcopi,
with one of the finest of the Perpendicular towers for which
Somersetshire is noted. Langport has a considerable general and
agricultural trade.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Langport (<i>Llongborth</i>, <i>Langeberga</i>, <i>Langeport</i>) owed its origin to its
defensible position on a hill, and its growth to its facilities for trade
on the chief river of Somerset. It occupies the site of the British town
of Llongborth, and was important during the Roman occupation.
It was a royal borough in Saxon times, and in 1086 had 34 resident
burgesses. The first charter, given by Elizabeth in 1562, recognized
that Langport was a borough of great antiquity, which had enjoyed
considerable privileges, being governed by a portreve. It was incorporated
by James I. in 1617, but the corporation was abolished in
1883. Langport was represented in parliament in 1304 and 1306.
The charter of 1562 granted three annual fairs to Langport, on the
28th of June, the 11th of November and the second Monday in Lent.
One fair only is now held, on the 3rd of September, which is a horse
and cattle fair. A Saturday market was held under the grant of
1562, but in the 19th century the market day was changed to
Tuesday.</p>

1550 ft. on a jutting promontory of the tableland known as the
plateau de Langres, and overlooks eastward and westward
respectively the valleys of the Marne and its tributary the
Bonnelle. From the cathedral tower and the ramparts which
surround the town there is an extensive view over the valley
of the Marne, the Vosges and the Côte d&rsquo;Or, and in clear weather
Mt Blanc (160 m. distant) is visible. The cathedral of St Mammès,
for the most part in the Transitional style of the 12th century,
has a west front in the Graeco-Roman style of the 18th century
and a fine Renaissance chapel. The church of St Martin (13th,
15th and 18th centuries) possesses a figure of Christ of the 16th
century, one of the finest wood carvings known. The ramparts
are protected by several towers, most of which date from the
16th century. The Gallo-Roman gate, one of four entrances
in the Roman period, is preserved, but is walled up. The
Porte des Moulins (17th century) is the most interesting of the
other gates. The town possesses a museum rich in Gallo-Roman
antiquities, a picture gallery and an important library. The
birth of Denis Diderot here is commemorated by a statue.
Langres is the seat of a bishop and a sub-prefect, and has tribunals
of first instance and of commerce, a higher ecclesiastical seminary
and communal colleges for both sexes. It manufactures
well-known cutlery and grind-stones. Trade is in grain and
other farm-produce, live stock, wine, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Langres, the ancient <i>Andematunum</i>, was capital of the <i>Lingones</i>.
Under Roman rule it was at first to some extent autonomous,
but was reduced to the rank of colony after the revolt of the
chief Sabinus in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 71. The bishopric was founded about 200
and in the middle ages its holders became peers of the realm and
enjoyed the temporal power in the town. In 301 the Alemanni
were defeated at Langres by the Romans, but in the next century
it was burnt by the Vandals and by Attila.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;plateau of Langres&rdquo; appears frequently in the military
history of the 18th and 19th centuries as a dominant strategic point,
though its importance as such has appealed chiefly to the advocates
of wars of positions and passive defence. The modern fortifications
of Langres, which serves as a second line fortress, consist of (<i>a</i>) Fort
St Menge or Ligniville on high ground above the confluence of the
Marne and the Neuilly brook, about 5 m. N. by W. of the town;
(<i>b</i>) the west front, comprising Humes battery (2¼ m. N.W. of
Langres), Fort de la Pointe de Diamant, and the redoubts of
Perrancey, Le Fays and Noidant (the last 4 m. S.W. of the town),
overlooking the deep valley of the Mouche brook (this front was
attacked in the mock siege of August 1907); (<i>c</i>) the south front,
comprising Fort de la Bonnelle or Décrès (2 m. S.S.W. of the town), a
small work commanding the Chalon-Langres road, Le Mont and Le
Pailly batteries, Fort Vercingetorix, the last, 5 m. S.W. of the place,
standing on a steep and narrow spur of the main plateau, and in
second line the old fort de la Marnotte, and the large bastioned
citadel (the town enceinte is &ldquo;déclassée&rdquo;); (<i>d</i>) the east front, marked
by Forts Montlandon and Plesnoy at the north and south ends respectively
of a long steep ridge, 6 m. E. of Langres, the bridges over
the Marne leading to these works being commanded by Fort Peigney,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>178</span>
a work about half a mile east of the town; (<i>e</i>) Fort Dampierre, 8 m.
N.E. of the town, which commands all the main approaches from
the north, and completes the circle by crossing its fire with that of
Fort St Menge.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANGTOFT, PETER<a name="ar96" id="ar96"></a></span> (d. <i>c.</i> 1307), English chronicler, took
his name from the village of Langtoft in Yorkshire, and was
a canon of the Augustinian priory in Bridlington. His name
is also given as Langetoft and Langetost. He wrote in French
verse a <i>Chronicle</i> dealing with the history of England from the
earliest times to the death of Edward I. in 1307. It consists of
three parts and contains about 9000 rhyming verses. The
earlier part of the <i>Chronicle</i> is taken from Geoffrey of Monmouth
and other writers; for the period dealing with the reign of
Edward I. Langtoft is a contemporary and valuable authority,
especially for affairs in the north of England and in Scotland.
Langtoft&rsquo;s <i>Chronicle</i> seems to have enjoyed considerable popularity
in the north, and the latter part of it was translated into
English by Robert Mannyng, sometimes called Robert of Brunne,
about 1330. It has been edited for the Rolls Series by T. Wright

<p><span class="bold">LANGTON, JOHN<a name="ar97" id="ar97"></a></span> (d. 1337), chancellor of England and bishop
of Chichester, was a clerk in the royal chancery, and became
chancellor in 1292. He obtained several ecclesiastical appointments,
but owing to the resistance of Pope Boniface VIII. he
failed to secure the bishopric of Ely in 1298, although he was
supported by Edward I. and visited Rome to attain his end.
Resigning his office as chancellor in 1302, he was chosen bishop
of Chichester in 1305, and again became chancellor shortly after
the accession of Edward II. in 1307. Langton was one of the
&ldquo;ordainers&rdquo; elected in 1310, and it was probably his connexion
with this body that led to his losing the office of chancellor about
this time. He continued, however, to take part in public affairs;
mediating between the king and Earl Thomas of Lancaster in
1318, and attempting to do so between Edward and his rebellious
barons in 1321. He died in June or July 1337. Langton built
the chapterhouse at Chichester, and was a benefactor of the
university of Oxford.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANGTON, STEPHEN<a name="ar98" id="ar98"></a></span> (d. 1228), cardinal and archbishop of
Canterbury, was the son of English parents; but the date and
place of his birth are unknown. Since he became early in his
career a prebendary of York, and since his brother Simon
(d. 1248) was elected<a name="fa1f" id="fa1f" href="#ft1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a> to that see in 1215, we may suppose the
family to have been of northern extraction. Stephen, however,
migrated to Paris, and having graduated in that university
became one of its most celebrated theologians. This was
probably the time when he composed his voluminous commentaries
(many of which still exist in manuscript) and divided
the Bible into chapters. At Paris also he contracted the friendship
with Lothar of Segni, the future Innocent III., which played
so important a part in shaping his career. Upon becoming pope,
Innocent summoned Langton to Rome, and in 1206 designated
him as cardinal-priest of S. Chrysogonus. Immediately afterwards
Langton was drawn into the vortex of English politics.</p>

<p>Archbishop Hubert Walter had died in 1205, and the
election of his successor had raised thorny questions. The
suffragans of Canterbury claimed a share in choosing the new
primate, although that right had been exclusively reserved to
the monks of Canterbury by a papal privilege; and John
supported the bishops since they were prepared to give their
votes for his candidate, John de Gray, bishop of Norwich. A
party of the younger monks, to evade the double pressure of
the king and bishops, secretly elected their sub-prior Reginald
and sent him to Rome for confirmation. The plot leaked out;
the rest of the monks were induced to elect John de Gray, and
he too was despatched to Rome. After hearing the case Innocent
declared both elections void; and with John&rsquo;s consent ordered
that a new election should be made in his presence by the
representatives of the monks. The latter, having confessed
that they had given John a secret pledge to elect none but the
bishop of Norwich, were released from the promise by Innocent;
and at his suggestion elected Stephen Langton, who was consecrated
by the pope on the 17th of June 1207. On hearing the
news the king banished the monks of Canterbury and lodged
a protest with the pope, in which he threatened to prevent any
English appeals from being brought to Rome. Innocent replied
by laying England under an interdict (March 1208), and excommunicating
the king (November 1209). As John still
remained obstinate, the pope at length invited the French king
Philip Augustus to enter England and depose him. It was
this threat which forced John to sue for a reconciliation; and
the first condition exacted was that he should acknowledge
Langton as archbishop. During these years Langton had been
residing at Pontigny, formerly the refuge of Becket. He had
addressed to the English people a dignified protest against the
king&rsquo;s conduct, and had at last pressed the pope to take extreme
measures. But he had consistently adopted towards John
as conciliatory an attitude as his duty to the church would
allow, and had more than once entered upon negotiations for
a peaceful compromise. Immediately after entering England
(July 1213) he showed his desire for peace by absolving the king.
But, unlike the pope, he gave ear to the popular cry for redress
of political grievances; and persisted in associating with the
baronial opposition, even after he was ordered by Innocent
to excommunicate them as disturbers of the peace. Langton
encouraged the barons to formulate their demands, and is said
to have suggested that they should take their stand upon the
charter of Henry I. It is uncertain what further share he took
in drafting Magna Carta. At Runnymede he appeared as a
commissioner on the king&rsquo;s side, and his influence must therefore
be sought in those clauses of the Charter which differ from the
original petitions of the barons. Of these the most striking is
that which confirms the &ldquo;liberties&rdquo; of the church; and this
is chiefly remarkable for its moderation.</p>

<p>Soon after the issue of the charter the archbishop left England
to attend the Fourth Lateran Council. At the moment of his
departure he was suspended by the representatives of Innocent
for not enforcing the papal censures against the barons. Innocent
confirmed the sentence, which remained in force for two years.
During this time the archbishop resided at Rome. He was
allowed to return in 1218, after the deaths of Innocent and John.
From that date till his death he was a tower of strength to the
royal party. Through his influence Pandulf was recalled to
Rome (1221) and Honorius III. promised that no legate should
be sent to reside in England during the archbishop&rsquo;s lifetime.
In 1222, in a synod held at Oseney, he promulgated a set of
Constitutions still recognized as forming a part of the law of the
English Church. Beyond this little is recorded of his latter
years. He died on the 9th of July 1228, and was buried in
Canterbury Cathedral, where his tomb, unless tradition errs,
may still be seen.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The authorities are mainly those for the reign of John. No contemporary
biography has come down to us. Some letters, by Langton
and others, relating to the quarrel over his election are preserved in a
Canterbury Chronicle (ed. W. Stubbs in the &ldquo;Rolls&rdquo; edition of <i>Gervase
of Canterbury</i>, vol. ii.). There are many references to him in the
correspondence of Innocent III. (Migne&rsquo;s <i>Patrologia Latina</i>, vols.
ccxiv.-ccxvii.). Of modern works see F. Hurter, <i>Geschichte Papst
Innocenz III.</i> (Hamburg, 1841-1844); W. F. Hook, <i>Lives of the Archbishops
of Canterbury</i> (London, 1860-1876), and W. Stubbs&rsquo;s preface
to the second volume of <i>Walter of Coventry</i> (&ldquo;Rolls&rdquo; ed.), which devotes
special attention to Langton. The MSS. of Langton&rsquo;s writings
are noticed in J. Bale&rsquo;s <i>Index Britanniae scriptorum</i> (ed. R. L. Poole,
1902); his Constitutions are printed in D. Wilkin&rsquo;s <i>Concilia</i>, vol. ii.
(London, 1737).</p>

<p>Another English prelate who bore the name of Langton was
<span class="sc">Thomas Langton</span>, bishop of Winchester, chaplain to Edward IV.
In 1483 he was chosen bishop of St Davids; in 1485 he was made
bishop of Salisbury and provost of Queen&rsquo;s College, Oxford, and he
became bishop of Winchester in 1493. In 1501 he was elected archbishop
of Canterbury, but he died on the 27th of January 1501,

<p><span class="bold">LANGTON, WALTER<a name="ar99" id="ar99"></a></span> (d. 1321), bishop of Lichfield and
treasurer of England, was probably a native of Langton West
in Leicestershire. Appointed a clerk in the royal chancery,
he became a favourite servant of Edward I., taking part in the
suit over the succession to the Scottish throne in 1292, and
visiting France more than once on diplomatic business. He
obtained several ecclesiastical preferments, became treasurer
in 1295, and in 1296 bishop of Lichfield. Having become
unpopular, the barons in 1301 vainly asked Edward to dismiss
him; about the same time he was accused of murder, adultery
and simony. Suspended from his office, he went to Rome to
be tried before Pope Boniface VIII., who referred the case to
Winchelsea, archbishop of Canterbury; the archbishop, although
Langton&rsquo;s lifelong enemy, found him innocent, and this sentence
was confirmed by Boniface in 1303. Throughout these difficulties,
and also during a quarrel with the prince of Wales,
afterwards Edward II., the treasurer was loyally supported by
the king. Visiting Pope Clement V. on royal business in 1305,
Langton appears to have persuaded Clement to suspend Winchelsea;
after his return to England he was the chief adviser of
Edward I., who had already appointed him the principal executor
of his will. His position, however, was changed by the king&rsquo;s
death in July 1307. The accession of Edward II. and the return
of Langton&rsquo;s enemy, Piers Gaveston, were quickly followed by
the arrest of the bishop and his removal from office. His lands,
together with a great hoard of movable wealth, were seized,
and he was accused of misappropriation and venality. In spite
of the intercession of Clement V. and even of the restored archbishop,
Winchelsea, who was anxious to uphold the privileges
of his order, Langton, accused again by the barons in 1309,
remained in prison after Edward&rsquo;s surrender to the &ldquo;ordainers&rdquo;
in 1310. He was released in January 1312 and again became
treasurer; but he was disliked by the &ldquo;ordainers,&rdquo; who forbade
him to discharge the duties of his office. Excommunicated
by Winchelsea, he appealed to the pope, visited him at Avignon,
and returned to England after the archbishop&rsquo;s death in May
1313. He was a member of the royal council from this time
until his dismissal at the request of parliament in 1315. He
died in November 1321, and was buried in Lichfield cathedral,
which was improved and enriched at his expense. Langton
appears to have been no relation of his contemporary, John
Langton, bishop of Chichester.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANGUEDOC<a name="ar102" id="ar102"></a></span>, one of the old provinces of France, the name
of which dates from the end of the 13th century. In 1290 it
was used to refer to the country in whose tongue (<i>langue</i>) the
word for &ldquo;yes&rdquo; was <i>oc</i>, as opposed to the centre and north of
France, the <i>langue d&rsquo;oil</i> (the <i>oui</i> of to-day). Territorially
Languedoc varied considerably in extent, but in general from
1360 until the French Revolution it included the territory of
the following departments of modern France: part of Tarn
et Garonne, Tarn, most of Haute-Garonne, Ariège, Aude,
Pyrénées-Orientales, Hérault, Gard, Lozère, part of Ardèche
and Haute-Loire. The country had no natural geographical
unity. Stretching over the Cevennes into the valleys of the
upper Loire on the north and into that of the upper Garonne
on the west, it reached the Pyrenees on the south and the rolling
hills along the Rhone on the east. Its unity was entirely a
political creation, but none the less real, as it was the great state
of the Midi, the representative of its culture and, to some degree,
the defence of its peculiar civilization. Its climate, especially
in Hérault (Montpellier), is especially delightful in spring and
early summer, and the scenery still holds enough ruined remains
of Roman and feudal times to recall the romance and the tragedy
of its history.</p>

<p>Although the name is of comparatively late medieval origin,
the history of Languedoc, which had little in common with that
of northern France, begins with the Roman occupation. Toulouse
was an important place as early as 119 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>; the next year
Narbonne, the seaport, became a Roman colony. By the time
of Julius Caesar the country was sufficiently Romanized to
furnish him with men and money, and though at first involved
in the civil wars which followed, it prospered under Roman rule
as perhaps no other part of the empire did. While it corresponded
exactly to no administrative division of the Roman empire,
it was approximately the territory included in <i>Gallia Narbonensis</i>,
one of the seventeen provinces into which the empire was divided
at the death of Augustus. It was rich and flourishing, crowded
with great and densely populated towns, Nîmes, Narbonne,
Béziers, Toulouse; with schools of rhetoric and poetry still
vigorous in the 5th century; theatres, amphitheatres and
splendid temples. In the 5th century this high culture was an
open prize for the barbarians; and after the passing of the
Vandals, Suebi and Visigoths into Spain, the Visigoths returned
under Wallia, who made his capital at Toulouse in 419. This
was the foundation of the Visigothic kingdom which Clovis dismembered
in 507, leaving the Visigoths only Septimania&mdash;the
country of seven cities, Narbonne, Carcassonne, Elne, Béziers,
Maguelonne, Lodève and Agde&mdash;that is, very nearly the area
occupied later by the province of Languedoc. At the council
of Narbonne in 589 five races are mentioned as living in the
province, Visigoths, Romans, Jews&mdash;of whom there were a
great many&mdash;Syrians and Greeks. The repulse of the Arabs by
Charles Martel in 732 opened up the country for the Frankish
conquest, which was completed by 768. Under the Carolingians
Septimania became part of the kingdom of Aquitaine, but
became a separate duchy in 817.</p>

<p>Until the opening of the 13th century there is no unity in the
history of Languedoc, the great houses of Toulouse and Carcassonne
and the swarm of warlike counts and barons practically
ignoring the distant king of France, and maintaining a chronic
state of civil war. The feudal régime did not become at all
universal in the district, as it tended to become in the north of
France. Allodial tenures survived in sufficient numbers to constitute
a considerable class of non-vassal subjects of the king,
with whose authority they were little troubled. By the
end of the 11th century the house of the counts of Toulouse
began to play the predominant rôle; but their court had been
famous almost a century before for its love of art and literature
and its extravagance in dress and fashions, all of which denoted
its wealth. Constance, wife of King Robert II. and daughter
of the count of Toulouse, gave great offence to the monks by
her following of gallant gentlemen. They owed their tastes, not
only to their Roman blood, and the survival of their old love
for rhetoric and poetry, but also to their intercourse with the
Mahommedans, their neighbours and enemies, and their friends
when they were not fighting. Under Raymond of Saint Gilles,
at the end of the 11th century, the county of Toulouse began its
great career, but Raymond&rsquo;s ambition to become an Oriental
prince, which led him&mdash;and the hundred thousand men who,
according to the chroniclers, followed him&mdash;away on the first
crusade, left a troubled heritage to his sons Bertrand and Alphonse
Jourdain. The latter successfully beat off William IX., duke
of Aquitaine, and won from the count of Barcelona that part of
Provence between the Drôme and the Durance. The reign of
Alphonse lasted from 1109 to 1148. By the opening of the
13th century the sovereignty of the counts of Toulouse was
recognized through about half of Provence, and they held the
rich cities of the most cultured and wealthiest portion of France,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>180</span>
cities which had a high degree of local independence. Their
local governments, with their consuls at the head, show, at least
in name, the influence of Roman ideas. It is still an open
question how much of their autonomy had remained untouched
by the barbarian invasions from the Roman period. The citizens
of these free cities were in continual intercourse with Saracens
of Palestine and Moors of Spain; they had never entirely
abandoned pagan customs; their poetry&mdash;the poetry of the
troubadours&mdash;taught them the joys of life rather than the fear
of death, the licence of their chivalry with its courts of love
led to the other extreme of asceticism in such as were of religious
temperament; all things combined to make Languedoc the
proper soil for heresy. The Church never had the hold upon
the country that it had in the north, the people of the Midi were
always lukewarm in the faith; there was no noteworthy ecclesiastical
literature in Languedoc from the end of the Carolingian
period until after the Albigensian crusade, no theological centre
like Paris, Bec or Laon. Yet Languedoc furnished the most
heroic martyrs for the ascetic Manichaean creed. The era of
heresy began with the preaching of Peter de Brueys and his
follower, Henry of Lausanne, who emptied the churches and
taught contempt for the clergy. Saint Bernard himself was able
to make but temporary headway against this rebellion from
a sacramental and institutionalized Christianity. In the first
decade of the 13th century came the inevitable conflict. The
whole county of Toulouse, with its fiefs of Narbonne, Béziers,
Foix, Montpellier and Quercy, was in open and scornful secession
from the Catholic Church, and the suppression of this Manichaean
or Cathar religion was the end of the brilliant culture of
Languedoc. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Albigenses</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cathars</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Inquisition</a></span>.) The
crusade against the Albigenses, as the Cathars were locally termed,
in 1209, resulted in the union to the crown of France in 1229
of all the country from Carcassonne to the Rhone, thus dividing
Languedoc into two. The western part left to Raymond VII.,
by the treaty of 1229, included the Agenais, Quercy, Rouergue,
the Toulousain and southern Albigeois. He had as well the
Venaissin across the Rhone. From 1229 to his death in 1249
Raymond VII. worked tirelessly to bring back prosperity to
his ruined country, encouraging the foundation of new cities,
and attempting to gain reconciliation with the Church. He
left only a daughter, Jeanne, who was married to Alphonse
of Poitiers. Alphonse, a sincere Catholic, upheld the Inquisition,
but, although ruling the country from Paris, maintained peace.
Jeanne died without heirs four days after her husband, upon
their return from the crusade in Africa, in 1271, and although
she attempted by will to prevent the reversion of her lands to
the crown, they were promptly seized by King Philip III., who
used the opposition of Roger Bernard, count of Foix, as an
excuse to appear with a formidable army, which had little to
do to secure entire submission. Thus the county of Toulouse
passed to the crown, though Philip III. turned over the Agenais
to Edward I. of England in 1279. In 1274 he ceded the county
of Venaissin to Pope Gregory X., the papacy having claimed
it, without legal grounds, since the Albigensian crusade (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Avignon</a></span>).</p>

<p>Such was the fate of the reduced county of Toulouse. At the
division of Languedoc in 1229 Louis IX. was given all the
country from Carcassonne to the Rhone. This royal Languedoc
was at first subject to much trickery on the part of northern
speculators and government officials. In 1248 Louis IX. sent
royal <i>enquêteurs</i>, much like Charlemagne&rsquo;s <i>missi dominici</i>, to
correct all abuses, especially to inquire concerning peculation
by royal agents. On the basis of their investigations the king
issued royal edicts in 1254 and 1259 which organized the administration
of the province. Two <i>sénéchaussées</i> were created&mdash;one
at Nîmes, the other at Carcassonne&mdash;each with its lesser
divisions of <i>vigueries</i> and <i>bailliages</i>. During the reign of Philip
III. the <i>enquêteurs</i> were busily employed securing justice for
the conquered, preventing the seizure of lands, and in 1279
a supreme court of justice was established at Toulouse. In
1302 Philip IV. convoked the estates of Languedoc, but in the
century which followed they were less an instrument for self-government
than one for securing money, thus aiding the
<i>enquêteurs</i>, who during the Hundred Years&rsquo; War became mere
revenue hunters for the king. In 1355 the Black Prince led
a savage plundering raid across the country to Narbonne.
After the battle of Poitiers, Languedoc supported the count
of Armagnac, but there was no enthusiasm for a national cause.
Under Charles V., Louis of Anjou, the king&rsquo;s brother, was governor
of Languedoc, and while an active opponent of the English, he
drained the country of money. But his extortions were surpassed
by those of another brother, the duc de Berry, after the death
of Charles V. In 1382 and 1383 the infuriated peasantry, abetted
by some nobles, rose in a rebellion&mdash;known as the Tuchins&mdash;which
was put down with frightful butchery, while still greater
sums were demanded from the impoverished country. In the
anarchy which followed brigandage increased. Redress did
not come until 1420, when the dauphin, afterwards Charles VII.,
came to Languedoc and reformed the administration. Then the
country he saved furnished him with the means for driving out
the English in the north. For the first time, in the climax of
its miseries, Languedoc was genuinely united to France. But
Charles VII. was not able to drive out the brigands, and it
was not until after the English were expelled in 1453 that
Languedoc had even comparative peace. Charles VII. united
Comminges to the crown; Louis XI. Roussillon and Cerdagne,
both of which were ceded to Aragon by Charles VIII. as the
price of its neutrality during his expedition into Italy. From
the reign of Louis XI. until 1523 the governorship of Languedoc
was held by the house cf Bourbon. After the treason of the
constable Bourbon it was held by the Montmorency family
with but slight interruption until 1632.</p>

<p>The Reformation found Languedoc orthodox. Persecution
had succeeded. The Inquisition had had no victims since 1340,
and the cities which had been centres of heresy were now strongly
orthodox. Toulouse was one of the most fanatically orthodox
cities in Europe, and remained so in Voltaire&rsquo;s day. But Calvinism
gained ground rapidly in the other parts of Languedoc, and
by 1560 the majority of the population was Protestant. It was,
however, partly a political protest against the misrule of the
Guises. The open conflict came in 1561, and from that until
the edict of Nantes (1598) there was intermittent civil war,
accompanied with iconoclasm on the one hand, massacres on
the other and ravages on both.</p>

<p>The main figure in this period is that of Henri de Montmorency,
seigneur de Damville, later duc de Montmorency, governor of the
province from 1563, who was, at first, hostile to the Protestants,
then from 1574 to 1577, as leader of the &ldquo;<i>Politiques</i>,&rdquo; an advocate
of compromise. But peace was hardly ever established, although
there was a yearly truce for the ploughing. By the edict of
Nantes, the Protestants were given ten places of safety in
Languedoc; but civil strife did not come to an end, even under
Henry IV. In 1620 the Protestants in Languedoc rose under
Henri, duc de Rohan (1579-1638), who for two years defied
the power of Louis XIII. When Louis took Montpellier in 1622,
he attempted to reconcile the Calvinists by bribes of money and
office, and left Montauban as a city of refuge. Richelieu&rsquo;s
extinction of Huguenotism is less the history of Languedoc
than of the Huguenots (<i>q.v.</i>). By 1629 Protestantism was
crushed in the Midi as a political force. Then followed the
tragic episode of the rebellion of Henri II., duc de Montmorency,
son of the old governor of Languedoc. As a result, Languedoc
lost its old provincial privilege of self-assessment until 1649,
and was placed under the governorship of Marshal Schomberg.
During Louis XIV.&rsquo;s reign Languedoc prospered until the
revocation of the edict of Nantes. Industries and agriculture
were encouraged, roads and bridges were built, and the great
canal giving a water route from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean
increased the trade of its cities. Colbert especially encouraged
its manufactures. The religious persecutions which accompanied
the revocation of the edict of Nantes bore hardest on Languedoc,
and resulted in a guerilla warfare known as the rebellion of the
Camisards (<i>q.v.</i>). On the eve of the Revolution some of the
brightest scenes of contentment and prosperity which surprised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>181</span>
Arthur Young, the English traveller in France, were those of the
grape harvests in Languedoc vineyards.</p>

<p>In 1790 Languedoc disappeared from the map of France,
with the other old provinces; and the departments mentioned
took its place. But the peculiar characteristics of the men
of the Midi remain as clearly distinct from those of the north
as the Scottish type is distinct from the English. The &ldquo;peaceful
insurrection&rdquo; of the Languedoc vine-growers in the summer
of 1907 revealed to the astonished Parisians the same spirit of
independence as had underlain the resistance to Simon de
Montfort and Richelieu.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The one monumental history of Languedoc is that of the Benedictines,
Dom Claude Devic and Dom J. J. Vaissete, <i>Histoire générale
de la province de Languedoc</i> (5 vols., Paris, 1730-1745). This has been
re-edited, and continued and increased by the addition of important
monographs, to 15 volumes (Toulouse, 1872-1892). It is the great
library of sources, critical apparatus and bibliographies concerning
Languedoc, and carries the history up to 1790. The fine article
&ldquo;Languedoc&rdquo; in <i>La Grande Encyclopédie</i> is by A. Molinier, perhaps
the greatest modern authority on Languedoc.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANGUET, HUBERT<a name="ar103" id="ar103"></a></span> (1518-1581), French Huguenot writer
and diplomat, was born at Vitteaux in Burgundy, of which
town his father was governor. He received his early education
from a distinguished Hellenist, Jean Perelle, and displayed
remarkable ability in Greek and Latin. He studied law, theology
and science at the university of Poitiers from 1536 to 1539;
then, after some travel, attended the universities of Bologna
and Padua, receiving the doctorate from the latter in 1548.
At Bologna he read Melanchthon&rsquo;s <i>Loci communes theologiae</i>
and was so impressed by it that in 1549 he went to Wittenberg
to see the author, and shortly afterwards became a Protestant.
He made his headquarters at Wittenberg until the death of
Melanchthon in 1560, although during that period, as well as
throughout the rest of his life, he travelled extensively in France,
Italy, Spain, Germany, Sweden, and even Finland and Lapland.
In 1557 he declined the invitation of Gustavus I. to enter the
service of Sweden, but two years later accepted a similar invitation
of Augustus I., elector of Saxony. He showed great
ability in diplomacy, particularly in organizing the Protestants.
He represented the elector at the French court from 1561 to
1572 except when the religious and political troubles in France
occasionally compelled him temporarily to withdraw. He
performed many minor diplomatic missions for the elector,
and in 1567 accompanied him to the siege of Gotha. He delivered
a violent harangue before Charles IX. of France in 1570 on
behalf of the Protestant princes, and escaped death on St
Bartholomew&rsquo;s Day (1572) only through the intervention of
Jean de Morvilliers, the moderate and influential bishop of
Orleans. He represented the elector of Saxony at the imperial
court from 1573 to 1577. Financial embarrassment and disgust
at the Protestant controversies in which he was forced to participate
caused him to seek recall from the imperial court. His
request being granted, Languet spent the last years of his life
mainly in the Low Countries, and though nominally still in the
service of the elector, he undertook a mission to England for
John Casimir of Bavaria and was a valuable adviser to William
the Silent, prince of Orange. Languet died at Antwerp on the
30th of September 1581.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His correspondence is important for the history of the 16th
century. Three hundred and twenty-nine letters to Augustus of
Saxony dating from the 17th of November 1565 to the 8th of
September 1581, and one hundred and eleven letters to the chancellor
Mordeisen dating from November 1559 to the summer of 1565, are
preserved in MS. in the Saxon archives, and were published by
Ludovicus at Halle in 1699 under the title <i>Arcana seculi decimi sexti</i>.
One hundred and eight letters to Camerarius were published at
Groningen in 1646 under the title <i>Langueti Epistolae ad Joach.
Camerarium, patrem et filium</i>; and ninety-six to his great friend Sir
Philip Sidney, dating from the 22nd of April 1573 to the 28th of
October 1580, appeared at Frankfort in 1633 and have been translated
into English by S. A. Pears (London, 1845). The <i>Historica
Descriptio</i> of the siege and capture of Gotha appeared in 1568 and has
been translated into French and German. The authorship of the
work by which Languet is best known has been disputed. It is
entitled <i>Vindiciae contra tyrannos, sive de principis in populum
populique in principem legitima potestate, Stephano Junio Bruto Celta
auctore</i>, and is thought to have been published at Basel (1579)
although it bears the imprint of Edinburgh. It has been attributed
to Beza, Hotman, Casaubon and Duplessis-Mornay, by divers writers
on various grounds&mdash;to the last-named on the very respectable
authority of Grotius. The authorship of Languet was supported by
Peter Bayle (for reasons stated in the form of a supplement to the
<i>Dictionnaire</i>) and confirmed by practically all later writers. The work
has been frequently reprinted, the Leipzig edition (1846) containing
a life of Languet by Treitschke. A French translation appeared in
1581 and an English translation in 1689. The work upholds the
doctrine of resistance, but affirms that resistance must come from
properly constituted authorities and objects to anything which
savours of anabaptism or other extreme views. The <i>Apologie ou
défence du très illustre Prince Guillaume contre le ban et l&rsquo;édit du roi
d&rsquo;Espagne</i> (Leiden, 1581) is sometimes attributed to Languet.
There seems little doubt, however, that it was really the work of the
prince himself, with the help either of Languet (Groen van Prinsterer,
<i>Archives</i>) or of Pierre de Villiers (Motley, <i>Rise of the Dutch Republic</i>;
and Blok, <i>History of the People of the Netherlands</i>).</p>

<i>hanuman</i>) of the sacred Indian monkey scientifically known as
<i>Semnopithecus entellus</i>, and hence sometimes called the entellus
monkey. A prodigiously long tail, beetling eyebrows with long
black hairs, black ears, face, feet and hands, and a general
greyish-brown colour of the fur are the distinctive characteristics
of the langur. These monkeys roam at will in the bazaars of
Hindu cities, where they help themselves freely from the stores
of the grain-dealers, and they are kept in numbers at the great
temple in Benares. In a zoological sense the term is extended
to embrace all the monkeys of the Asiatic genus <i>Semnopithecus</i>,
which includes a large number of species, ranging from Ceylon,
India and Kashmir to southern China and the Malay countries
as far east as Borneo and Sumatra. These monkeys are characterized
by their lank bodies, long slender limbs and tail, well-developed
thumbs, absence of cheek-pouches, and complex
stomachs. They feed on leaves and young shoots.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANG VON WELLENBURG, MATTHÄUS<a name="ar105" id="ar105"></a></span> (1469-1540),
German statesman and ecclesiastic, was the son of a burgher of
Augsburg. He afterwards assumed the name of Wellenburg
from a castle that came into his possession. After studying at
Ingolstadt, Vienna and Tübingen he entered the service of the
emperor Frederick III. and quickly made his way to the front.
He was also one of the most trusted advisers of Frederick&rsquo;s son
and successor Maximilian I., and his services were rewarded in
1500 with the provostship of the cathedral at Augsburg and in
the following year with the bishopric of Gurk. In 1511 he was
made a cardinal by Pope Julius II., and in 1514 he became
coadjutor to the archbishop of Salzburg, whom he succeeded in
1519. He also received the bishopric of Cartagena in Murcia in
1521, and that of Albano in 1535. Lang&rsquo;s adherence to the older
faith, together with his pride and arrogance, made him very
unpopular in his diocese of Salzburg; in 1523 he was involved
in a serious struggle with his subjects, and in 1525, during the
Peasants&rsquo; War, he had again to fight hard to hold his own. He
was one of the chief ministers of Charles V.; he played an
important part in the tangled international negotiations of his
time; and he was always loyal to his imperial masters. Not
without reason has he been compared with Cardinal Wolsey. He
died on the 30th of March 1540.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANIER, SIDNEY<a name="ar106" id="ar106"></a></span> (1842-1881), American poet, was born at
Macon, Georgia, on the 3rd of February 1842. He was of
Huguenot descent on his father&rsquo;s side, and of Scottish and
Virginian on his mother&rsquo;s. From childhood he was passionately
fond of music. His subsequent mastery of the flute helped to
support him and greatly increased his reputation. At the age of
fourteen he entered Oglethorpe College, where, after graduating
with distinction, he held a tutorship. He enlisted in the Confederate
army in April 1861, serving first in Virginia, and finding
opportunities to continue his studies. After the Seven Days&rsquo;
battles around Richmond, he was transferred to the signal service.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>182</span>
About this time the first symptoms of consumption appeared.
He subsequently served in a blockade-runner, but his vessel was
captured, and he was confined for five months in a Federal
prison, his flute proving the best of companions. Exchanged
early in 1865, he started home on foot, arriving in a state of
exhaustion that led to a severe illness. In 1867 he visited New
York in connexion with his novel <i>Tiger Lilies</i>&mdash;an immature
work, dealing in part with his war experiences, and now difficult
to obtain. Later in the same year he took charge of a country
school in Alabama, and was married to Miss Mary Day of his
native town. The next year he returned to Macon in low health,
and began to study and practise law with his father. In 1872
he went to Texas for his health, but was forced to return, and he
secured an engagement as first flute in the Peabody concerts at
Baltimore (December 1873). He wrote a guide-book to Florida
(1876), and tales for boys from Froissart, Malory, the Mabinogion
and Percy&rsquo;s <i>Reliques</i> (1878-1882). He now made congenial
friends, such as Bayard Taylor, his reputation gradually increased,
and he was enabled to study music and literature,
especially Anglo-Saxon poetry. In 1876 he wrote his ambitious
cantata for the Centennial Exhibition, and brought his family
north. A small volume of verse appeared in the next year. In
1879 he was made lecturer on English literature at Johns Hopkins
University. His lectures became the basis of his <i>Science of
English Verse</i> (1880)&mdash;his most important prose work, and an
admirable discussion of the relations of music and poetry&mdash;and
also of his <i>English Novel</i> (New York, 1883), which, devoted
largely to George Eliot, is suggestive, but one-sided. Work had
to be abandoned on account of growing feebleness, and in the
spring of 1881 he was carried to Lynn, North Carolina, to try
camp life, and died there on the 7th of September. Since his
death his fame has grown steadily and greatly, an enlarged and
final edition (1884) of his poems, prepared by his wife, his <i>Letters,
1866-1881</i> (1899), and several volumes of miscellaneous prose
having assisted in keeping his name before the public. A
posthumous work on <i>Shakspere and his Forerunners</i> (London,
2 vols., 1902) was edited by H. W. Lanier. Among his more
noteworthy poems are &ldquo;Corn,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Revenge of Hamish,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Song of the Chattahoochee&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Marshes of Glynn.&rdquo;
By some his genius is regarded as musical rather than poetic, and
his style is considered hectic; by others he is held to be one of
the most original and most talented of modern American poets.
He is considered the leading writer of the New South, the greatest
Southern poet since Poe, and a man of heroic and exquisite
character.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANJUINAIS, JEAN DENIS,<a name="ar107" id="ar107"></a></span> <span class="sc">Comte</span> (1753-1827), French
politician, was born at Rennes (Ille-et-Vilaine) on the 12th of
March 1753. After a brilliant college career, which made him
doctor of laws and a qualified barrister at nineteen, he was
appointed counsel to the Breton estates and in 1775 professor of
ecclesiastical law at Rennes. At this period he wrote two
important works which, owing to the distracted state of public
affairs, remained unpublished, <i>Institutiones juris ecclesiastici</i>
and <i>Praelectiones juris ecclesiastici</i>. He had begun his career at
the bar by pleading against the feudal <i>droit du colombier</i>, and
when he was sent by his fellow-citizens to the states-general of
1789 he demanded the abolition of nobility and the substitution of
the title of king of the French and the Navarrese for king of
France and Navarre, and helped to establish the civil constitution
of the clergy. Returned to the Convention in September 1792
he developed moderate, even reactionary views, becoming one
of the fiercest opponents of the Mountain, though he never
wavered in his support of republican principles. He refused to
vote for the death of Louis XVI., alleging that the nation had no
right to despatch a vanquished prisoner. His daily attacks on
the Mountain resulted, on the 15th of April 1793, in a demand
by the commune for his exclusion from the assembly, but, undaunted,
when the Parisian populace invaded the Chamber on
the 2nd of June, Lanjuinais renewed his defiance of the victorious
party. Placed under arrest with the Girondins, he escaped to
Rennes where he drew up a pamphlet denouncing the constitution
of 1793 under the curious title <i>Le Dernier Crime de Lanjuinais</i>
(Rennes, 1793). Pursued by J. B. Carrier, who was sent to
stamp out resistance in the west, he lay hidden until some time
after the revolution of Thermidor (July 1794), but he was readmitted
to the Convention on the 8th of March 1795. He
maintained his liberal and independent attitude in the Conseil
des Anciens, the Senate and the Chamber of Peers, being president
of the upper house during the Hundred Days. Together with
G. J. B. Target, J. E. M. Portalis and others he founded under the
empire an academy of legislation in Paris, himself lecturing on
Roman law. Closely associated with oriental scholars, and a
keen student of oriental religions, he entered the Academy of
Inscriptions in 1808. After the Bourbon restoration Lanjuinais
consistently defended the principles of constitutional monarchy,
but most of his time was given to religious and political subjects.
Besides many contributions to periodical literature he wrote,
among other works, <i>Constitutions de la nation française</i> (1819);
<i>Appréciation du projet de loi relatif aux trois concordats</i> (1806,
6th ed. 1827), in defence of Gallicanism; and <i>Études biographiques
et littéraires sur Antoine Arnauld, P. Nicole et Jacques
Necker</i> (1823). He died in Paris on the 13th of January 1827.</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">Victor Ambroise, Vicomte de Lanjuinais</span> (1802-1869),
was also a politician, becoming a deputy in 1838. His
interests lay chiefly in financial questions and in 1849 he became
minister of commerce and agriculture in the cabinet of Odilon
Barrot. He wrote a <i>Notice historique sur la vie et les ouvrages du
comte de Lanjuinais</i>, which was prefixed to an edition of his
father&rsquo;s <i>&OElig;uvres</i> (4 vols., 1832).</p>

Sanskrit scholar, was born in Norwich, Connecticut, on the 8th of
July 1850. He graduated at Yale in 1871, was a graduate student
there (1871-1873) under James Hadley and W. D. Whitney, and
in Germany (1873-1876) studied Sanskrit under Weber and Roth
and philology under Georg Curtius and Leskien. He was professor
of Sanskrit at Johns Hopkins University in 1876-1880
and subsequently at Harvard University. In 1889 he travelled
in India and bought for Harvard University Sanskrit and
Pr&#257;krit books and manuscripts, which, with those subsequently
bequeathed to the university by Fitzedward Hall, make the
most valuable collection of its kind in America, and made
possible the <i>Harvard Oriental Series</i>, edited by Professor Lanman.
In 1879-1884 he was secretary and editor of the <i>Transactions</i>,

<p><span class="bold">LANNES, JEAN<a name="ar109" id="ar109"></a></span>, duke of Montebello (1769-1809), marshal
of France, was born at Lectoure (Gers) on the 11th of April
1769. He was the son of a livery stables keeper, and was
apprenticed to a dyer. He had had little education, but his great
strength and proficiency in all manly sports caused him in 1792
to be elected sergeant-major of the battalion of volunteers of
Gers, which he had joined on the breaking out of war between
Spain and the French republic. He served through the campaigns
in the Pyrenees in 1793 and 1794, and rose by distinguished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>183</span>
conduct to the rank of <i>chef de brigade</i>. However, in 1795, on
the reform of the army introduced by the Thermidorians, he
was dismissed from his rank. He re-enlisted as a simple volunteer
in the army of Italy, and in the famous campaign of 1796 he again
fought his way up to high rank, being eventually made a general
of brigade by Bonaparte. He was distinguished in every
battle, and was wounded at Arcola. He was chosen by Bonaparte
to accompany him to Egypt as commander of one of
Kléber&rsquo;s brigades, in which capacity he greatly distinguished
himself, especially on the retreat from Syria. He went with
Bonaparte to France, assisted at the 18th Brumaire, and was
appointed general of division, and commandant of the consular
guard. He commanded the advanced guard in the crossing of
the Alps in 1800, was instrumental in winning the battle of
Montebello, from which he afterwards took his title, and bore
the brunt of the battle of Marengo. In 1801 Napoleon sent him
as ambassador to Portugal. Opinions differ as to his merits in
this capacity; Napoleon never made such use of him again.
On the establishment of the empire he was created a marshal
of France, and commanded once more the advanced guard of a
great French army in the campaign of Austerlitz. At Austerlitz
he had the left of the Grand Army. In the 1806-07 campaign
he was at his best, commanding his corps with the greatest credit
in the march through the Thuringian Forest, the action of Saalfeld
(which is studied as a model to-day at the French Staff College)
and the battle of Jena. His leadership of the advanced guard
at Friedland was even more conspicuous. He was now to be
tried as a commander-in-chief, for Napoleon took him to Spain
in 1808, and gave him a detached wing of the army, with which
he won a victory over Castaños at Tudela on November 22.
In January 1809 he was sent to attempt the capture of Saragossa,
and by February 21, after one of the most stubborn defences
in history, was in possession of the place. Napoleon then created
him duc de Montebello, and in 1809, for the last time, gave him
command of the advanced guard. He took part in the engagements
around Eckmühl and the advance on Vienna. With his
corps he led the French army across the Danube, and bore the
brunt, with Masséna, of the terrible battle of Aspern-Essling
(<i>q.v.</i>). On the 22nd of May he had to retreat. During the retreat
Lannes exposed himself as usual to the hottest fire, and received
a mortal wound, to which he succumbed at Vienna on the 31st
of May. As he was being carried from the field to Vienna he
met the emperor hurrying to the front. It was reported that
the dying man reproached Napoleon for his ambition, but this
rests on little evidence save the fact that Lannes was the most
blunt and outspoken of all Napoleon&rsquo;s marshals. He was one
of the few men for whom the emperor felt a real and deep
affection, and at this their last meeting Napoleon gave way to
a passionate burst of grief, even in the midst of the battle. His
eldest son was made a peer of France by Louis XVIII.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Lannes ranks with Davout and Masséna as the ablest of all
Napoleon&rsquo;s marshals, and consciously or unconsciously was the best
exponent of the emperor&rsquo;s method of making war. Hence his
constant employment in tasks requiring the utmost resolution and
daring, and more especially when the emperor&rsquo;s combinations depended
upon the vigour and self-sacrifice of a detachment or fraction
of the army. It was thus with Lannes at Friedland and at Aspern
as it was with Davout at Austerlitz and Auerstädt, and Napoleon&rsquo;s
estimate of his subordinates&rsquo; capacities can almost exactly be judged
by the frequency with which he used them to prepare the way for his
own shattering blow. Routine generals with the usual military
virtue, or careful and exact troop leaders like Soult and Macdonald,
Napoleon kept under his own hand for the final assault which he
himself launched, but the long hours of preparatory fighting against
odds of two to one, which alone made the final blow possible, he entrusted
only to men of extraordinary courage and high capacity for
command. In his own words, he found Lannes a pigmy, and lost
him a giant. Lannes&rsquo;s place in his affections was never filled.</p>

On an eminence close to Lannion is the church of
Brélevenez of the 12th century, restored in the 15th or 16th
century; it has an interesting 16th-century Holy Sepulchre.</p>

<p>Some 6 m. S.E. of the town are the imposing ruins of the
château of Tonquédec (<i>c.</i> 1400) styled the &ldquo;Pierrefonds of
Brittany,&rdquo; and there are other buildings of antiquarian interest
in the vicinity. The coast north of Lannion at Trégastel and
Ploumanac presents curious rock formations.</p>

<p>Lannion is the seat of a subprefect and has a tribunal of
first instance and a communal college. Its industries include
saw-milling, tanning and the manufacture of farm implements.
The town was taken in 1346 by the English; it was defended
against them by Geoffroy de Pontblanc whose valour is commemorated
by a cross close to the spot where he was slain.</p>

of Sluys, and a knight of the Golden Fleece. He discharged
several diplomatic missions in France, England, Prussia, Poland
and Lithuania, and was one of the negotiators of the treaty of
Troyes (1420). In 1421 he was sent by Henry V. of England
to Palestine to inquire into the possibility of reviving the kingdom
of Jerusalem, and wrote an account of his travels, <i>Les Pèlerinages

name of the preparation styled <i>adeps lanae hydrosus</i> in the British
Pharmacopoeia, and which consists of 7 oz. of neutral wool-fat
(<i>adeps lanae</i>) mixed with 3 fluid oz. of water. The wool-fat
is obtained by purification of the &ldquo;brown grease,&rdquo; &ldquo;recovered
grease&rdquo; or dégras extracted from raw sheep&rsquo;s wool in the process
of preparing it for the spinner. It is a translucent unctuous
substance which has the property of taking up large quantities
of water and forming emulsions which are very slow to separate
into their constituents. Owing to the ease with which it penetrates
the skin, wool-fat both in the anhydrous form and as
lanolin, sometimes mixed with such substances as vaseline or
fatty oils, is largely employed as a basis for ointments. It is
slightly antiseptic and does not become rancid.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA NOUE, FRANÇOIS DE<a name="ar113" id="ar113"></a></span> (1531-1591), called Bras-de-Fer,
one of the Huguenot captains of the 16th century, was born
near Nantes in 1531, of an ancient Breton family. He served
in Italy under Marshal Brissac, and in the first Huguenot war,
but his first great exploit was the capture of Orleans at the head
of only fifteen cavaliers in 1567, during the second war. At the
battle of Jarnac in March 1569 he commanded the rearguard,
and at Moncontour in the following October he was taken
prisoner; but he was exchanged in time to resume the governorship
of Poitou, and to inflict a signal defeat on the royalist
troops before Rochefort. At the siege of Fontenay (1570) his
left arm was shattered by a bullet; but a mechanic of Rochelle
made him an iron arm (hence his sobriquet) with a hook for
holding his reins. When peace was made in France in the same
year, La Noue carried his sword against the Spaniards in the
Netherlands, but was taken at the recapture of Mons by the
Spanish in 1572. Permitted to return to France, he was commissioned
by Charles IX., after the massacre of St Bartholomew,
to reconcile the inhabitants of La Rochelle, the great stronghold
of the Huguenots, to the king. But the Rochellois were too
much alarmed to come to terms; and La Noue, perceiving
that war was imminent, and knowing that his post was on the
Huguenot side, gave up his royal commission, and from 1574
till 1578 acted as general of La Rochelle. When peace was again
concluded La Noue once more went to aid the Protestants of
the Low Countries. He took several towns and captured Count
Egmont in 1580; but a few weeks afterwards he fell into the
hands of the Spaniards. Thrust into a loathsome prison at Limburg,
La Noue, the admiration of all, of whatever faith, for his
gallantry, honour and purity of character, was kept confined
for five years by a powerful nation, whose reluctance to set him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>184</span>
free is one of the sincerest tributes to his reputation. It was in
captivity that he wrote his celebrated <i>Discours politiques et
militaires</i>, a work which was published at Basel in 1587 [republished
at La Rochelle 1590, Frankfurt on Main (in German)
1592 and 1612; and London (in English) 1597] and had an immense
influence on the soldiers of all nations. The abiding value of
La Noue&rsquo;s &ldquo;Discourses&rdquo; lies in the fact that he wrote of war
as a human drama, before it had been elaborated and codified.
At length, in June 1585, La Noue was exchanged for Egmont
and other prisoners of consideration, while a heavy ransom and
a pledge not to bear arms against his Catholic majesty were
also exacted from him. Till 1589 La Noue took no part in public
matters, but in that year he joined Henry of Navarre against
the Leaguers. He was present at both sieges of Paris, at Ivry
and other battles. At the siege of Lamballe in Brittany he
received a wound of which he died at Moncontour on the 4th
of August 1591.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>He wrote, besides the Discourses, <i>Déclaration pour prise d&rsquo;armes et
la défense de Sedan et Jamets</i> (1588); <i>Observations sur l&rsquo;histoire de

<p><span class="bold">LANSDOWNE, WILLIAM PETTY FITZMAURICE,<a name="ar114" id="ar114"></a></span> <span class="sc">1st
Marquess of</span> (1737-1805), British statesman, better known under
his earlier title of earl of Shelburne, was born at Dublin on the
20th of May 1737. He was a descendant of the lords of Kerry
(dating from 1181), and his grandfather Thomas Fitzmaurice,
who was created earl of Kerry (1723), married the daughter of
Sir William Petty (<i>q.v.</i>). On the death without issue of Sir
William Petty&rsquo;s sons, the first earls of Shelburne, the estates
passed to his nephew John Fitzmaurice (advanced in 1753 to the
earldom of Shelburne), who in 1751 took the additional name of
Petty. His son William spent his childhood &ldquo;in the remotest
parts of the south of Ireland,&rdquo; and, according to his own account,
when he entered Christ Church, Oxford, in 1755, he had both
&ldquo;everything to learn and everything to unlearn.&rdquo; From a
tutor whom he describes as &ldquo;narrow-minded&rdquo; he received
advantageous guidance in his studies, but he attributes his
improvement in manners and in knowledge of the world chiefly
to the fact that, as was his &ldquo;fate through life,&rdquo; he fell in &ldquo;with
clever but unpopular connexions.&rdquo; Shortly after leaving the
university he served in Wolfe&rsquo;s regiment during the Seven Years&rsquo;
War, and so distinguished himself at Minden and Kloster-Kampen
that he was raised to the rank of colonel and appointed aide-de-camp
to the king (1760). Being thus brought into near communication
with Lord Bute, he was in 1761 employed by that
nobleman to negotiate for the support of Henry Fox, Lord
Holland. He was returned to the House of Commons as member
for Wycombe, but in 1761 he succeeded his father as earl of
Shelburne in the Irish peerage, and Baron Wycombe in the
peerage of Great Britain (created 1760). Though he declined
to take office under Bute he undertook negotiations to induce
C. J. Fox to gain the consent of the Commons to the peace of
1763. Fox affirmed that he had been duped, and, although
Shelburne always asserted that he had acted in thorough good
faith, Bute spoke of the affair as a &ldquo;pious fraud.&rdquo; Shelburne
joined the Grenville ministry in 1763 as president of the Board
of Trade, but, failing in his efforts to replace Pitt in the cabinet,
he in a few months resigned office. Having moreover on account
of his support of Pitt on the question of Wilkes&rsquo;s expulsion from
the House of Commons incurred the displeasure of the king, he
retired for a time to his estate. After Pitt&rsquo;s return to power
in 1766 he became secretary of state, but during Pitt&rsquo;s illness
his conciliatory policy towards America was completely thwarted
by his colleagues and the king, and in 1768 he was dismissed
from office. In 1782 he consented to take office under the
marquess of Rockingham on condition that the king would
recognize the United States. On the death of Lord Rockingham
in the same year he became premier; but the secession of
Fox and his supporters led to the famous coalition of Fox with
North, which caused his resignation in the following February,
his fall being perhaps hastened by his plans for the reform of
the public service. He had also in contemplation a bill to promote
free commercial intercourse between England and the
United States. When Pitt acceded to office in 1784, Shelburne,
instead of receiving a place in the cabinet, was created marquess
of Lansdowne. Though giving a general support to the policy
of Pitt, he from this time ceased to take an active part in public
affairs. He died on the 7th of May 1805. During his lifetime
he was blamed for insincerity and duplicity, and he incurred
the deepest unpopularity, but the accusations came chiefly from
those who were dissatisfied with his preference of principles to
party, and if he had had a more unscrupulous regard to his
personal ambition, his career as a statesman would have had
more outward success. He was cynical in his estimates of
character, but no statesman of his time possessed more enlightened
political views, while his friendship with those of his
contemporaries eminent in science and literature must be
allowed considerable weight in qualifying our estimate of the
moral defects with which he has been credited. He was twice
married, first to Lady Sophia (1745-1771), daughter of John
Carteret, Earl Granville, through whom he obtained the Lansdowne
estates near Bath, and secondly to Lady Louisa (1755-1789),
daughter of John Fitzpatrick, 1st earl of Upper Ossory.
John Henry Petty Fitzmaurice (1765-1809), his son by the
first marriage, succeeded as 2nd marquess, after having sat in
the House of Commons for twenty years as member for Chipping
Wycombe.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Henry Petty Fitzmaurice</span>, 3rd marquess of Lansdowne
(1780-1863), son of the 1st marquess by his second marriage,
was born on the 2nd of July 1780 and educated at Edinburgh
University and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He entered the
House of Commons in 1802 as member for the family borough
of Calne and quickly showed his mettle as a politician. In
February 1806, as Lord Henry Petty, he became chancellor of
the exchequer in the ministry of &ldquo;All the Talents,&rdquo; being at
this time member for the university of Cambridge; but he lost
both his seat and his office in 1807. In 1809 he became marquess
of Lansdowne; and in the House of Lords and in society he
continued to play an active part as one of the Whig leaders. His
chief interest was perhaps in the question of Roman Catholic
emancipation, a cause which he consistently championed, but
he sympathized also with the advocates of the abolition of the
slave-trade and with the cause of popular education. Lansdowne,
who had succeeded his cousin, Francis Thomas Fitzmaurice,
as 4th earl of Kerry in 1818, took office with Canning in May
1827 and was secretary for home affairs from July of that year
until January 1828; he was lord president of the council under
Earl Grey and then under Lord Melbourne from November 1830
to August 1841, with the exception of the few months in 1835
when Sir Robert Peel was prime minister. He held the same
office during the whole of Lord John Russell&rsquo;s ministry (1846-1852),
and, having declined to become prime minister, sat in the
cabinets of Lord Aberdeen and of Lord Palmerston, but without
office. In 1857 he refused the offer of a dukedom, and he died
on the 31st of January 1863. Lansdowne&rsquo;s social influence and
political moderation made him one of the most powerful Whig
statesmen of the time; he was frequently consulted by Queen
Victoria on matters of moment, and his long official experience
made his counsel invaluable to his party. He married Louisa
(1785-1851), daughter of the 2nd earl of Ilchester, and was
succeeded by his son Henry, the 4th marquess (1816-1866).
The latter, who was member of parliament for Calne for twenty
years and chairman of the Great Western railway, married for
his second wife Emily (1819-1895), daughter of the comte de
Flahaut de la Billarderie, a lady who became Baroness Nairne
in her own right in 1867. By her he had two sons, the 5th
marquess and Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice (Baron Fitzmaurice
of Leigh).</p>

<p><span class="sc">Henry Charles Keith Petty Fitzmaurice</span>, 5th marquess of
Lansdowne (b. 1845), was educated at Balliol, Oxford, where
he became one of Jowett&rsquo;s favourite pupils. In 1869 he married
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>185</span>
the daughter of the 1st duke of Abercorn. As a member of the
Liberal party he was a lord of the treasury (1869-1872), under-secretary
of war (1872-1874), and under-secretary of India
(1880); in 1883 he was appointed governor-general of Canada,
and from 1888 to 1893 he was viceroy of India. He joined the
Liberal Unionist party when Mr Gladstone proposed home rule
for Ireland, and on returning to England became one of its most
influential leaders. He was secretary of state for war from
1895 to 1900, and foreign secretary from 1900 to 1906, becoming
leader of the Unionist party in the House of Lords on Lord
Salisbury&rsquo;s death.</p>

<p>His brother <span class="sc">Edmond George Fitzmaurice</span>, Baron Fitzmaurice
(b. 1846), was educated at Trinity, Cambridge, where
he took a first class in classics. Unlike Lord Lansdowne, he
remained a Liberal in politics and followed Mr Gladstone in his
home rule policy. As Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice he entered
the House of Commons in 1868, and was under-secretary for
foreign affairs from 1882 to 1885. He then had no seat in parliament
till 1898, when he was elected for the Cricklade division of
Wilts, and retiring in 1905, he was created Baron Fitzmaurice
of Leigh in 1906, and made under-secretary for foreign affairs
in Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman&rsquo;s ministry. In 1908 he
became chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster and a member of
the Liberal cabinet, but resigned his post in 1909. He devoted
much time to literary work, and was the author of excellent
biographies of the 1st marquess, of Sir William Petty (1895),
and of Lord Granville (1905), under whom he had served at the
foreign office.</p>

Pop. (1900) 16,485, of whom 2397 were foreign-born; (1910
census) 31,229. It is served by the Michigan Central, the
Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern, the Grand Trunk and the
Père Marquette railways, and by interurban electric lines. The
Grand river on its way through the city makes a horse-shoe bend
round a moderately elevated plateau; this is the commercial
centre of the city, and here, in a square covering 10 acres, is the
State Capitol, erected in 1873-1878 and containing the State
library. On the opposite side of the river, farther N., and also
extending across the southern portion of the city, are districts
devoted largely to manufacturing. Lansing has a public library
and a city hospital. About 3 m. E. of the city, at East Lansing,
is the State Agricultural College (coeducational), the oldest
agricultural college in the United States, which was provided
for by the state constitution of 1850, was organized in 1855
and opened in 1857. Its engineering course was begun in 1885;
a course in home economics for women was established in 1896;
and a forestry course was opened in 1902. In connexion with
the college there is an agricultural experiment station. Lansing
is the seat of the Michigan School for the Blind, and of the State
Industrial School for Boys, formerly the Reform School. The
city has abundant water-power and is an important manufacturing
centre. The value of the factory products increased
from $2,942,306 in 1900 to $6,887,415 in 1904, or 134.1%. The
municipality owns and operates the water-works and the electric-lighting
plant. The place was selected as the site for the
capital in 1847, when it was still covered with forests, and
growth was slow until 1862, when the railways began to reach
it. Lansing was chartered as a city in 1859 and rechartered in
1893.</p>

intentional burial. The skull is preserved in the U. S.

<p><span class="bold">LANSQUENET,<a name="ar118" id="ar118"></a></span> the French corrupted form of the German
<i>Landsknecht</i> (<i>q.v.</i>), a mercenary foot-soldier of the 16th century.
It is also the name of a card game said to have been introduced
into France by the <i>Landsknechte</i>. The pack of 52 cards is cut
by the player at the dealer&rsquo;s right. The dealer lays the two first
cards face upwards on the table to his left; the third he places
in front of him and the fourth, or <i>réjouissance</i> card, in the middle
of the table. The players, usually called (except in the case of
the dealer) <i>punters</i>, stake any sum within the agreed limit upon
this réjouissance card; the dealer, who is also the banker,
covers the bets and then turns up the next card. If this fails to
match any of the cards already exposed, it is laid beside the
réjouissance card and then punters may stake upon it. Other
cards not matching are treated in the same manner. When a
card is turned which matches the réjouissance card, the banker
wins everything staked on it, and in like manner he wins what
is staked on any card (save his own) that is matched by the
card turned. The banker pays all stakes, and the deal is over
as soon as a card appears that matches his own; excepting
that should the two cards originally placed at his left both be
matched before his own, he is then entitled to a second deal.
In France matching means winning, not losing, as in Great
Britain. There are other variations of play on the continent of
Europe.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANTARA, SIMON MATHURIN<a name="ar119" id="ar119"></a></span> (1729-1778), French landscape
painter, was born at Oncy on the 24th of March 1729.
His father was a weaver, and he himself began life as a herdboy;
but, having attracted the notice of Gille de Reumont, a son of his
master, he was placed under a painter at Versailles. Endowed
with great facility and real talent, his powers found ready
recognition; but he found the constraint of a regular life and
the society of educated people unbearably tiresome; and as long
as the proceeds of the last sale lasted he lived careless of the
future in the company of obscure workmen. Rich amateurs
more than once attracted him to their houses, only to find that
in ease and high living Lantara could produce nothing. He died
in Paris on the 22nd of December 1778. His works, now
much prized, are not numerous; the Louvre has one landscape,
&ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; signed and dated 1761. Bernard, Joseph
Vernet, and others are said to have added figures to his landscapes
and sea-pieces. Engravings after Lantara will be
found in the works of Lebas, Piquenot, Duret, Mouchy and
others. In 1809 a comedy called <i>Lantara, or the Painter
in the Pothouse</i>, was brought out at the Vaudeville with great
success.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANTERN<a name="ar120" id="ar120"></a></span> (an adaptation of the Fr. <i>lanterne</i> from Lat.
<i>lanterna</i> or <i>laterna</i>, supposed to be from Gr. <span class="grk" title="lamptêr">&#955;&#945;&#956;&#960;&#964;&#942;&#961;</span>, a torch or
lamp, <span class="grk" title="lampein">&#955;&#940;&#956;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>, to shine, cf. &ldquo;lamp&rdquo;; the 16th- and 17th-century
form &ldquo;lanthorn&rdquo; is due to a mistaken derivation from &ldquo;horn,&rdquo;
as a material frequently used in the making of lanterns), a metal
case filled in with some transparent material, and used for holding
a light and protecting it from rain or wind. The appliance is of
two kinds&mdash;the hanging lantern and the hand lantern&mdash;both of
which are ancient. At Pompeii and Herculaneum have been
discovered two cylindrical bronze lanterns, with ornamented
pillars, to which chains are attached for carrying or hanging the
lantern. Plates of horn surrounded the bronze lamp within, and
the cover at the top can be removed for lighting and for the escape
of smoke. The hanging lantern for lighting rooms was composed
of ornamental metal work, of which iron and brass were perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>186</span>
most frequently used. Silver, and even gold, were, however,
sometimes employed, and the artificers in metal of the 17th and
18th centuries produced much exceedingly artistic work of this
kind. Oriental lanterns in open-work bronze were often very
beautiful. The early lantern had sides of horn, talc, bladder or
oiled paper, and the primitive shape remains in the common
square stable lantern with straight glass sides, to carry a candle.
The hand lantern was usually a much more modest appliance
than the hanging lantern, although in great houses it was sometimes
richly worked and decorated. As glass grew cheaper it
gradually ousted all other materials, but the horn lantern which
was already ancient in the 13th century was still being used in
the early part of the 19th. By the end of the 18th century
lanterns in rooms had been superseded by the candlestick.
The collapsible paper lanterns of China and Japan, usually known
as Chinese lanterns, are globular or cylindrical in shape, and the
paper is pleated and when not in use folds flat. For illuminative
and decorative purposes they are coloured with patterns of
flowers, &amp;c. The lanterns carried by the ordinary foot passenger
are made of oiled paper. In China the &ldquo;Feast of Lanterns&rdquo;
takes place early in the New Year and lasts for four days. In
Japan the festival of Bon is sometimes known as the &ldquo;feast of
lanterns.&rdquo; It is then that the spirits of the dead ancestors return
to the household altar. The festival takes place in July. The
&ldquo;bull&rsquo;s-eye&rdquo; lantern has a convex lens which concentrates the
light and allows it to be thrown in the shape of a diverging cone.
The &ldquo;dark lantern&rdquo; has a shutter or slide arrangement by which
the light can be shut off at will. Ships&rsquo; lanterns are used as
masthead or other signal lights. On Trajan&rsquo;s column is a representation
of a heavy poop-lantern on a ship. The ships&rsquo; lanterns
of the 16th and 17th centuries were highly ornamental, especially
when placed on the poop. At the Armeria Real in Madrid is a
collection of these 16th-century ships&rsquo; lanterns. The protected
cages which contain the lights used in lighthouses are also known
as &ldquo;lanterns&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lighthouses</a></span>).</p>

<p>In architecture a lantern is primarily a framework of timber,
with windows all round, to admit ample light, placed on the top
of a roof. In a broader sense, it is applied to those portions of
buildings which are largely perforated with windows, and more
especially to the upper part of the towers of cathedrals and
churches, as in the octagon of Ely cathedral, or the tower of
Boston church, Lincolnshire. The term is also applied to the
entire church, as in the case of Bath Abbey church, which was
called the &ldquo;lantern of England,&rdquo; from the number of its windows,
and St John&rsquo;s Priory at Kilkenny, the &ldquo;lantern of Ireland,&rdquo; on
account of the window on the south side of the choir which was
54 ft. long. In the Renaissance style the lantern was looked upon

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Magic or Optical Lantern.</i></p>

<p>The magic or optical lantern is an instrument for projecting
on a white wall or screen largely magnified representations of
transparent pictures painted or photographed on glass, or of
objects&mdash;crystals, animals, &amp;c.&mdash;carried on glass slides or in
glass vessels. If the light traverses the object, the projection
is said to be diascopic, if by reflected light, episcopic.</p>

<p>The invention of the magic lantern is usually attributed to
Athanasius Kircher, who described it in the first edition (1646)
of his <i>Ars magna lucis et umbrae</i>, but it is very probably of earlier
discovery. For a long period the magic lantern was used chiefly
to exhibit comic pictures, or in the hands of so-called wizards
to summon up ghosts and perform other tricks, astonishing to
those ignorant of the simple optical principles employed. Within
recent years, however, the optical lantern has been greatly
improved in construction, and its use widely extended. By
its means finely executed photographs on glass can be shown
greatly magnified to large audiences, thus saving the trouble
and expense of preparing large diagrams. When suitably
constructed, it can be used in the form of a microscope to exhibit
on a screen the forms and movements of minute living organisms,
or to show to an audience delicate physical and chemical experiments
which could otherwise be seen only by a few at a time
Another application of the optical lantern is found in the
cinematograph (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The optical lantern, in its simpler forms, consists of the following
parts: (1) the lantern body, (2) a source of light, (3) an optical
system for projecting the images. The lantern body is a rectangular
casing usually made of Russian iron, but sometimes covered with
wood (which must be protected by asbestos at parts liable to damage
by heat), provided with the openings necessary to the insertion of the
source of light, windows for viewing the same, a chimney for conveying
away the products of combustion, fittings to carry the slides
and the optical system. In the earlier and simpler lanterns, oil lamps
were commonly used, and in the toy forms either an oil flame or an
ordinary gas jet is still employed. Natural petroleum burnt in a
specially constructed lamp by means of two or three parallel wicks
set edgeways to the lenses was employed in the sciopticon, an improved
lantern invented in America which gave well-defined pictures
6 to 10 ft. in diameter. The Argand gas burner also found application.
A great improvement attended the introduction of lime-light, <i>i.e.</i>
the light emitted by a block of lime made incandescent by an impinging
oxyhydrogen or oxygen-coal-gas flame, and the readiness
with which hydrogen and oxygen can be prepared and rendered
available by compression in steel cylinders and the increased commercial
supply of coal-gas greatly popularized these illuminants.
Many improvements have been made on the original apparatus.
The lime-cylinders are specially prepared to withstand better the
disintegrating effects of the flame, and are mounted on a rotating pin
in order that fresh surfaces may be brought into play. Cones of
zirconia are also used in the same way; or a thorium mantle in
conjunction with alcohol vapour may be employed. Two types of
burner are in use: (1) the &ldquo;blow-through jet,&rdquo; in which the oxygen
is forced through the jet of the burning gas (this is the safest type),
and (2) where the gases are mixed before combustion (this is the more
dangerous but also the more powerful type). Ether burners are also
in use. In one type the oxygen supply is divided into two streams,
one of which passes through a chamber containing cotton wool
soaked with ether, and then rejoins the undiverted stream at the jet.
The application of the incandescent gas mantle is limited by the
intensity of the heat emitted and the large area of the source. Of
electrical illuminants the platinum and carbon filament lamps are
not much used, the Nernst lamp (in which the preliminary heating is
effected by a spirit lamp and not by an auxiliary coil) being preferred.
But the arc light is undoubtedly the best illuminant for use in the
projecting lantern. The actual size of the source is comparatively
small, and hence it is necessary to mount the carbons so that the
arc remains at one point on the axis of the optical system. It is also
advisable to set back the carbons relatively to one another and to tilt
them, so that the brightest part of the &ldquo;crater&rdquo; faces the lens.</p>

<p><i>Optical System.</i>&mdash;In the ordinary (or vertically) projecting lantern
the rays are transmitted through a lens termed the &ldquo;condenser,&rdquo;
then through the object, and finally through another lens termed the
&ldquo;objective.&rdquo; In the horizontally projecting types the light, after
passing through the condenser, is reflected vertically by a plane
mirror inclined at 45° to the direction of the light; it then traverses
another lens, then the object, then the objective, and is finally
projected horizontally by a plane mirror inclined at 45°, or by a
right angled glass prism, the hypothenuse face of which is silvered.
In episcopic projection, the light, having traversed the condenser,
is reflected on to the object, placed horizontally, by an inclined
mirror. The rays reflecting the object then traverse the objective,
and are then projected horizontally by a mirror or prism. This device
inverts the object; a convenient remedy is to place an erecting prism
before the lens. The object of the condenser is to collect as much
light as possible from the source, and pass it through the object in a
uniform beam. For this purpose the condenser should subtend as
large an angle as possible at the source of light. To secure this, it
should be tolerably large, and its distance from the light, that is, its
focal length, small. Since effective single lenses of large diameter are
necessarily of long focus, a really good condenser of considerable
diameter and yet of short focus must be a combination of two or
more lenses. It is essential that the condenser be white and limpid
and free from defects or striae.</p>

<p>In the earlier lanterns, as still in the cheaper forms, only a single
plano-convex lens or bull&rsquo;s-eye was employed as a condenser. A
good compound condenser for ordinary work is that proposed by
Herschel, consisting of a biconvex lens and a meniscus mounted
together with the concave side of the meniscus next the light.
Other types employ two plano-convex lenses, the curved surfaces
nearly in contact; or a concavo-convex and a plano-convex lens.
Or it may be a triple combination, the object always being to increase
the aperture. The focus must not be so short as to bring the lens too
near the light, and render it liable to crack from the intense heat.
In some lanterns this is guarded against by placing a plate of thin
glass between the condenser and the light. If the source of light be
broad, an iris diaphragm may be introduced so as to eliminate
inequalities in illumination.</p>

<p>The function of the objective is to produce a magnified inverted
image of the picture on the screen. In toy lanterns it is a simple
double-convex lens of short focus. This, however, can only produce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>187</span>
a small picture, and that not very distinct at the edges. The best
objective is the portrait combination lens usually of the Petzval
type as used in ordinary photographic cameras. These are carefully
corrected both for spherical and chromatic aberration, which is
absolutely essential in the objective, although not so necessary in the
condenser.</p>

<p><i>Objects.</i>&mdash;The commonest objects used for exhibiting with the
optical lantern are named &ldquo;slides&rdquo; and consist of pictures printed on
transparent surfaces. Solid objects mounted on glass after the
ordinary manner of mounting microscopic objects are also possible
of exhibition, and hollow glass tanks containing organisms or
substances undergoing some alteration are also available for use with
the lantern. If it be necessary to eliminate the heat rays, which may
act deleteriously on the object, a vessel is introduced containing
either water or a 5% solution of ferric chloride. In the ordinary
slide the pictures are painted with transparent water or oil colours,
or photographed on pieces of glass. If parts of the picture are to be
movable, two disks of glass are employed, the one movable in front
of the other, the fixed part of the picture being painted on the fixed
disk and the movable part on the other. By means of a lever the
latter disk is moved in its own plane; and in this way a cow, for
instance, can be represented drinking, or a donkey cutting amusing
capers. In the chromatrope slide two circular disks of glass are
placed face to face, each containing a design radiating from the
centre, and painted with brilliant transparent colours. By a small
pinion gearing in toothed wheels or endless bands the disks are made
to move in opposite directions in their own plane. The effect produced
is a singularly beautiful change of design and colour. In
astronomical slides the motions of the heavenly bodies, eclipses, the
phases of the moon or the like are similarly represented by mechanical
means.</p>

<p><i>Dissolving Views.</i>&mdash;For this purpose two magic lanterns are
necessary, arranged either side by side or the one on the top of the
other. The fronts of the lanterns are slightly inclined to each other
so as to make the illuminated disks on the screen due to each lantern
coincide. By means of a pair of thin metallic shutters terminating
in comb-like teeth, and movable by a rack or lever, the light from
either lantern can be gradually cut off at the same time that the light
from the other is allowed gradually to fall on the screen. In this way
one view appears to melt or dissolve into another. This arrangement
was first adopted by Childe in 1811.</p>

<p><i>Phantasmagoria.</i>&mdash;In this arrangement the pictures on the screen
appear gradually to increase or diminish in size and brightness. To
effect this a semi-transparent screen of cotton or other material is
used, the lantern being behind and the audience in front. The
lantern is mounted on wheels so that it can be rapidly moved up
to or withdrawn from the screen; and an automatic arrangement
is provided whereby simultaneously with this the objective is made
to approach or recede from the slide so as to focus the picture on
the screen in any position of the lantern. In this way a very small
picture appears gradually to grow to enormous dimensions.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANTERN-FLY<a name="ar121" id="ar121"></a></span>, the name given to insects belonging to the
homopterous division of the Hemiptera, and referable to the
genus <i>Fulgora</i> and allied forms. They are mostly of large size,
with a superficial resemblance to lepidoptera due to their brilliant
and varied coloration. Characteristic of the group is the presence
on the front of the head of a hollow process, simulating a snout,
which is sometimes inflated and as large as the rest of the insect,
sometimes elongated, narrow and apically upturned. It was
believed, mainly on the authority of Marie Sibylle de Mérian,
that this process, the so-called &ldquo;lantern,&rdquo; was luminous at
night. Linnaeus adopted the statement without question and
made use of a number of specific names, such as <i>lanternaria</i>,
<i>phosphorea</i>, <i>candelaria</i>, &amp;c., to illustrate the supposed fact, and
thus aided in disseminating a belief which subsequent observations
have failed to establish and which is now generally
rejected.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANTERNS OF THE DEAD<a name="ar122" id="ar122"></a></span>, the architectural name for the
small towers in stone, found chiefly in the centre and west of
France, pierced with small openings at the top, where a light
was exhibited at night to indicate the position of a cemetery.
These towers were usually circular, with a small entrance in the
lower part giving access to the interior, so as to raise the lamps
by a pulley to the required height. One of the most perfect
in France is that at Cellefrouin (Charente), which consists of a
series of eight attached semicircular shafts, raised on a pedestal,
and is crowned with a conical roof decorated with fir cones;
it has only one aperture, towards the main road. Other examples
exist at Ciron (Indre) and Antigny (Vienne).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANTHANUM<a name="ar123" id="ar123"></a></span> [symbol La, atomic weight 139.0 (O = 16)] one
of the metals of the cerium group of rare earths. Its name is
derived from the Gr. <span class="grk" title="lanthanein">&#955;&#945;&#957;&#952;&#940;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>, to lie hidden. It was first isolated
in 1839 by C. G. Mosander from the &ldquo;cerium&rdquo; of J. Berzelius.
It is found in the minerals gadolinite, cerite, samarskite and
fergusonite, and is usually obtained from cerite. For details
of the complex process for the separation of the lanthanum
salts from cerite, see R. Bunsen (<i>Pogg. Ann.</i>, 1875, 155, p. 377);
P. T. Cleve (<i>Bull. de la soc. chim.</i>, 1874, 21, p. 196); and A.
v. Welsbach (<i>Monats. f. Chem.</i>, 1884, 5, p. 508). The metal
was obtained by Mosander on heating its chloride with potassium,
and by W. F. Hillebrand and T. Norton (<i>Pogg. Ann.</i>, 1875,
156, p. 466) on electrolysis of the fused chloride, while C.
Winkler (<i>Ber.</i>, 1890, 23, p. 78) prepared it by heating the oxide
with a mixture of magnesium and magnesia. Muthmann and
Weiss (<i>Ann.</i>, 1904, 331, p. 1) obtained it by electrolysing the
anhydrous chloride. It may be readily hammered, but cannot
be drawn. Its specific gravity is 6.1545, and it melts at 810°.
It decomposes cold water slowly, but hot water violently. It
burns in air, and also in chlorine and bromine, and is readily
oxidized by nitric acid.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Lanthanum oxide</i>, La<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">3</span>, is a white powder obtained by burning
the metal in oxygen, or by ignition of the carbonate, nitrate or
sulphate. It combines with water with evolution of heat, and on
heating with magnesium powder in an atmosphere of hydrogen forms
a hydride of probable composition La<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">3</span> (C. Winkler, <i>Ber.</i> 1891, 24,
p. 890). <i>Lanthanum hydroxide</i>, La(OH)<span class="su">3</span>, is a white amorphous
powder formed by precipitating lanthanum salts by potassium
hydroxide. It decomposes ammonium salts. <i>Lanthanum chloride</i>,
LaCl<span class="su">3</span>, is obtained in the anhydrous condition by heating lanthanum
ammonium chloride or, according to C. Matignon (<i>Compt. rend.</i>,
1905, 40, p. 1181), by the action of chlorine or hydrochloric acid on
the residue obtained by evaporating the oxide with hydrochloric
acid. It forms a deliquescent crystalline mass. By evaporation of a
solution of lanthanum oxide in hydrochloric acid to the consistency
of a syrup, and allowing the solution to stand, large colourless
crystals of a hydrated chloride of the composition 2LaCl<span class="su">3</span>·15H<span class="su">2</span>O are
obtained. <i>Lanthanum sulphide</i>, La<span class="su">2</span>S<span class="su">3</span>, is a yellow powder, obtained
when the oxide is heated in the vapour of carbon bisulphide. It is
decomposed by water, with evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen.
<i>Lanthanum sulphate</i>, La<span class="su">2</span>(SO<span class="su">4</span>)<span class="su">3</span>·9H<span class="su">2</span>O, forms six-sided prisms,
isomorphous with those of the corresponding cerium salt. By careful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>188</span>
heating it may be made to yield the anhydrous salt. <i>Lanthanum
nitrate</i>, La(NO<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">3</span>·6H<span class="su">2</span>O, is obtained by dissolving the oxide in nitric
acid. It crystallizes in plates, and is soluble in water and alcohol.
<i>Lanthanum carbide</i>, LaC<span class="su">2</span>, is prepared by heating the oxide with
carbon in the electric furnace (H. Moissan, <i>Compt. rend.</i>, 1896, 123,
p. 148). It is decomposed by water with the formation of acetylene,
methane, ethylene, &amp;c. <i>Lanthanum carbonate</i>, La<span class="su">2</span>CO<span class="su">3</span>·8H<span class="su">2</span>O, occurs
as the rare mineral lanthanite, forming greyish-white, pink or
yellowish rhombic prisms. The atomic weight of lanthanum has
been determined by B. Brauner (<i>Proc. Chem. Soc.</i>, 1901, 17, p. 63)
by ignition of lanthanum sulphate at 500° C., the value obtained
being 139 (O = 16).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANUVIUM<a name="ar124" id="ar124"></a></span> (more frequently <i>Lanivium</i> in imperial times,
mod. <i>Civita Lavinia</i>), an ancient city of Latium, some 19 m.
S.E. of Rome, a little S.W. of the Via Appia. It was situated
on an isolated hill projecting S. from the main mass of the Alban
Hills, and commanding an extensive view over the low country
between it and the sea. It was one of the members of the Latin
League, and remained independent until conquered by Rome
in 338 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> At first it did not enjoy the right of Roman citizenship,
but acquired it later; and even in imperial times its chief
magistrate and municipal council kept the titles of <i>dictator</i>
and <i>senatus</i> respectively. It was especially famous for its
rich and much venerated temple of Juno Sospes, from which
Octavian borrowed money in 31 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and the possessions of
which extended as far as the sea-coast (T. Ashby in <i>Mélanges
de l&rsquo;école française</i>, 1905, 203). It possessed many other temples,
repaired by Antoninus Pius, who was born close by, as was also
Commodus. Remains of the ancient theatre and of the city
walls exist in the modern village, and above it is an area surrounded
by a portico, in <i>opus reticulatum</i>, upon the north side
of which is a rectangular building in <i>opus quadratum</i>, probably
connected with the temple of Juno. Here archaic decorative
terra-cottas were discovered in excavations carried on by Lord
Savile. The acropolis of the primitive city was probably on
the highest point above the temple to the north. The neighbourhood,
which is now covered with vineyards, contains remains
of many Roman villas, one of which is traditionally attributed to
Antoninus Pius.</p>

Italian politician, was born at Casale, Piedmont, on
the 15th of February 1810. He studied medicine at Turin, and
practised for some years in his native place. He was one of the
promoters of the agrarian association in Turin, and took an
active part in the rising of 1848. He was elected to the Piedmontese
parliament in that year, and attached himself to the
party of Cavour, devoting his attention chiefly to questions of
economy and finance. He became minister of public instruction
in 1855 in the cabinet of Cavour, and in 1858 minister of finance.
He followed Cavour into his temporary retirement in July 1859
after the peace of Villafranca, and for a year (1860-1861) was
president of the Chamber. He was minister of the interior
(1864-1865) in the La Marmora cabinet, and arranged the transference
of the capital to Florence. He maintained a resolute
opposition to the financial policy of Menabrea, who resigned
when Lanza was a second time elected, in 1869, president of
the Chamber. Lanza formed a new cabinet in which he was
himself minister of the interior. With Quintino Sella as minister
of finance he sought to reorganize Italian finance, and resigned
office when Sella&rsquo;s projects were rejected in 1873. His cabinet
had seen the accomplishment of Italian unity and the installation
of an Italian government in Rome. He died in Rome on
the 9th of March 1882.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANZAROTE,<a name="ar126" id="ar126"></a></span> an island in the Atlantic Ocean, forming part
of the Spanish archipelago of the Canary Islands (<i>q.v.</i>). Pop.
(1900) 17,546; area, 326 sq. m. Lanzarote, the most easterly
of the Canaries, has a length of 31 m. and a breadth varying
from 5 to 10 m. It is naked and mountainous, bearing everywhere
marks of its volcanic origin. Montaña Blanca, the highest
point (2000 ft.), is cultivated to the summit. In 1730 the appearance
of half the island was altered by a volcanic outburst. A
violent earthquake preceded the catastrophe, by which nine
villages were destroyed. In 1825 another volcanic eruption
took place accompanied by earthquakes, and two hills were
thrown up. The port of Naos on the south-east of the island
affords safe anchorage. It is protected by two forts. A short
distance inland is the town of Arrecife (pop. 3082). The climate
is hot and dry. There is only a single spring of fresh water on
the island, and that in a position difficult of access. From the
total failure of water the inhabitants were once compelled to
abandon the island. Dromedaries are used as beasts of burden.
Teguise (pop. 3786), on the north-west coast, is the residence of
the local authorities. A strait about 6 m. in width separates
Lanzarote from Fuerteventura.</p>

<p>Graciosa, a small uninhabited island, is divided from the
north-eastern extremity of Lanzarote by a channel 1 m. in
width, which affords a capacious and safe harbour for large
ships; but basaltic cliffs, 1500 ft. high, prevent intercourse with
the inhabited part of Lanzarote. A few persons reside on the
little island Allegranza, a mass of lava and cinders ejected at
various times from a now extinct volcano, the crater of which
has still a well-defined edge.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LANZI, LUIGI<a name="ar127" id="ar127"></a></span> (1732-1810), Italian archaeologist, was born
in 1732 and educated as a priest. In 1773 he was appointed
keeper of the galleries of Florence, and thereafter studied
Italian painting and Etruscan antiquities and language. In
the one field his labours are represented by his <i>Storia Pittorica
della Italia</i>, the first portion of which, containing the Florentine,
Sienese, Roman and Neapolitan schools, appeared in 1792,
the rest in 1796. The work is translated by Roscoe. In archaeology
his great achievement was <i>Saggio di lingua Etrusca</i> (1789),
followed by <i>Saggio delle lingue Ital. antiche</i> (1806). In his
memoir on the so-called Etruscan vases (<i>Dei vasi antichi dipinti
volgarmente chiamati Etruschi</i>, 1806) Lanzi rightly perceived
their Greek origin and characters. What was true of the antiquities
would be true also, he argued, of the Etruscan language,
and the object of the <i>Saggio di lingua Etrusca</i> was to prove that
this language must be related to that of the neighbouring
peoples&mdash;Romans, Umbrians, Oscans and Greeks. He was
allied with E. Q. Visconti in his great but never accomplished
plan of illustrating antiquity altogether from existing literature
and monuments. His notices of ancient sculpture and its various
styles appeared as an appendix to the <i>Saggio di lingua Etrusca</i>,
and arose out of his minute study of the treasures then added
to the Florentine collection from the Villa Medici. The abuse he
met with from later writers on the Etruscan language led
Corssen (<i>Sprache der Etrusker</i>, i. p. vi.) to protest in the name
of his real services to philology and archaeology. Among his
other productions was an edition of Hesiod&rsquo;s <i>Works and Days</i>,
with valuable notes, and a translation in <i>terza rima</i>. Begun in
1785, it was recast and completed in 1808. The list of his works
closes with his <i>Opere sacre</i>, a series of treatises on spiritual
subjects. Lanzi died on the 30th of March 1810. He was
buried in the church of the Santa Croce at Florence by the side
of Michelangelo.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAOCOON<a name="ar129" id="ar129"></a></span>, in Greek legend a brother of Anchises, who had
been a priest of Apollo, but having profaned the temple of the
god he and his two sons were attacked by serpents while preparing
to sacrifice a bull at the altar of Poseidon, in whose service
Laocoon was then acting as priest. An additional motive for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>189</span>
his punishment consisted in his having warned the Trojans
against the wooden horse left by the Greeks. But, whatever
his crime may have been, the punishment stands out even
among the tragedies of Greek legend as marked by its horror&mdash;particularly
so as it comes to us in Virgil (<i>Aeneid</i>, ii. 199 sq.),
and as it is represented in the marble group, the Laocoon, in
the Vatican. In the oldest existing version of the legend&mdash;that
of Arctinus of Miletus, which has so far been preserved in the
excerpts of Proclus&mdash;the calamity is lessened by the fact that
only one of the two sons is killed; and this, as has been pointed
out (<i>Arch. Zeitung</i>, 1879, p. 167), agrees with the interpretation
which Goethe in his <i>Propylaea</i> had put on the marble group
without reference to the literary tradition. He says: &ldquo;The
younger son struggles and is powerless, and is alarmed; the
father struggles ineffectively, indeed his efforts only increase
the opposition; the elder son is least of all injured, he feels
neither anguish nor pain, but he is horrified at what he sees
happening to his father, and he screams while he pushes the coils
of the serpent off from his legs. He is thus an observer, witness,
and participant in the incident, and the work is then complete.&rdquo;
Again, &ldquo;the gradation of the incident is this: the father has
become powerless among the coils of the serpent; the younger
son has still strength for resistance but is wounded; the elder
has a prospect of escape.&rdquo; Lessing, on the other hand, maintained
the view that the marble group illustrated the version
of the legend given by Virgil, with such differences as were
necessary from the different limits of representation imposed
on the arts of sculpture and of poetry. These limits required a
new definition, and this he undertook in his still famous work,
<i>Laokoon</i> (see the edition of Hugo Blümner, Berlin, 1876, in
which the subsequent criticism is collected). The date of the
Laocoon being now fixed (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Agesander</a></span>) to 40-20 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, there
can be no question of copying Virgil. The group represents
the extreme of a pathetic tendency in sculpture (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Greek Art</a></span>,

<p><span class="bold">LAODICEA,<a name="ar130" id="ar130"></a></span> the name of at least eight cities, founded or
renovated in the later Hellenic period. Most of them were
founded by the Seleucid kings of Syria. Seleucus, founder of
the dynasty, is said by Appian to have named five cities after his
mother Laodice. Thus in the immense realm of the Seleucidae
from the Aegean Sea to the borders of India we find cities called
Laodicea, as also Seleucia (<i>q.v.</i>). So long as Greek civilization
held its ground, these were the commercial and social centres.
The chief are Laodicea <i>ad Lycum</i> (see below); <i>Combusta</i> on
the borders of Phrygia, Lycaonia and Pisidia; a third in Pontus;
a fourth, <i>ad mare</i>, on the coast of Syria; a fifth, <i>ad Libanum</i>,
beside the Lebanon mountains; and three others in the far east&mdash;Media,
Persia and the lower Tigris valley. In the latter countries
Greek civilization was short-lived, and the last three cities disappeared;
the other five continued great throughout the Greek
and Roman period, and the second, third and fourth retain to
the present day the ancient name under the pronunciation Ladik,
Ladikiyeh or Latakia (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p><span class="sc">Laodicea ad Lycum</span> (mod. <i>Denizli</i>, <i>q.v.</i>) was founded
probably by Antiochus II. Theos (261-46 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), and named after
his wife Laodice. Its site is close to the station of Gonjeli on the
Anatolian railway. Here was one of the oldest homes of Christianity
and the seat of one of the seven churches of the Apocalypse.
Pliny states (v. 29) that the town was called in older times
Diospolis and Rhoas; but at an early period Colossae, a few
miles to the east, and Hierapolis, 6 m. to the north, were the
great cities of the neighbourhood, and Laodicea was of no importance
till the Seleucid foundation (Strabo, p. 578). A favourable site
was found on some low hills of alluvial formation, about 2 m. S.
of the river Lycus (Churuk Su) and 9 m. E. of the confluence of the
Lycus and Maeander. The great trade route from the Euphrates
and the interior passed to it through Apamea. There it forked,
one branch going down the Maeander valley to Magnesia and
thence north to Ephesus, a distance of about 90 m., and the other
branch crossing the mountains by an easy pass to Philadelphia
and the Hermus valley, Sardis, Thyatira and at last Pergamum.
St Paul (Col. iv. 15) alludes to the situation of Laodicea beside
Colossae and Hierapolis; and the order in which the last five
churches of the Apocalypse are enumerated (Rev. i. 11) is
explained by their position on the road just described. Placed
in this situation, in the centre of a very fertile district, Laodicea
became a rich city. It was famous for its money transactions
(Cic. <i>Ad Fam.</i> ii. 17, iii. 5), and for the beautiful soft wool
grown by the sheep of the country (Strabo 578). Both points are
referred to in the message to the church (Rev. iii. 17, 18).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Little is known of the history of the town. It suffered greatly
from a siege in the Mithradatic war, but soon recovered its prosperity
under the Roman empire. The Zeus of Laodicea, with the
curious epithet Azeus or Azeis, is a frequent symbol on the city coins.
He is represented standing, holding in the extended right hand an
eagle, in the left a spear, the <i>hasta pura</i>. Not far from the city was
the temple of Men Karou, with a great medical school; while
Laodicea itself produced some famous Sceptic philosophers, and
gave origin to the royal family of Polemon and Zenon, whose curious
history has been illustrated in recent times (W. H. Waddington,
<i>Mélanges de Numism.</i> ser. ii.; Th. Mommsen, <i>Ephem. Epigraph.</i> i.
and ii.; M. G. Rayet, <i>Milet et le Golfe Latmique</i>, chap. v.). The city
fell finally into decay in the frontier wars with the Turkish invaders.
Its ruins are of wide extent, but not of great beauty or interest;
there is no doubt, however, that much has been buried beneath the
surface by the frequent earthquakes to which the district is exposed
(Strabo 580; Tac. <i>Ann.</i> xiv. 27).</p>

Baronius argues for 314, and others for a date as late as 399),
adopted sixty canons, chiefly disciplinary, which were declared
ecumenical by the council of Chalcedon, 451. The most significant
canons are those directly affecting the clergy, wherein the
clergy appear as a privileged class, far above the laity, but with
sharply differentiated and carefully graded orders within itself.
For example, the priests are not to be chosen by the people;
penitents are not to be present at ordinations (lest they should
hear the failings of candidates discussed); bishops are to be
appointed by the metropolitan and his suffragan; sub-deacons
may not distribute the elements of the Eucharist; clerics are
forbidden to leave a diocese without the bishop&rsquo;s permission.
Other canons treat of intercourse with heretics, admission of
penitent heretics, baptism, fasts, Lent, angel-worship (forbidden
as idolatrous) and the canonical books, from which the
Apocrypha and Revelation are wanting.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAOMEDON,<a name="ar132" id="ar132"></a></span> in Greek legend, son of Ilus, king of Troy and
father of Podarces (Priam). The gods Apollo and Poseidon
served him for hire, Apollo tending his herds, while Poseidon
built the walls of Troy. When Laomedon refused to pay the
reward agreed upon, Apollo visited the land with a pestilence,
and Poseidon sent up a monster from the sea, which ravaged
the land. According to the oracle, the wrath of Poseidon could
only be appeased by the sacrifice of one of the king&rsquo;s daughters.
The lot fell upon Hesione, who was chained to a rock to await
the monster&rsquo;s coming. Heracles, on his way back from the
land of the Amazons, offered to slay the monster and release
Hesione, on condition that he should receive the wonderful
horses presented by Zeus to Tros, the father of Ganymede, to
console him for the loss of his son. Again Laomedon broke his
word; whereupon Heracles returned with a band of warriors,
attacked Troy, and slew Laomedon and all his sons except
Priam. According to Diodorus Siculus, Laomedon aggravated
his offence by imprisoning Iphiclus and Telamon, who had been
sent by Heracles to demand the surrender of the horses. Laomedon
was buried near the Scaean gate, and it was said that
so long as his grave remained undisturbed, so long would the
walls of Troy remain impregnable.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAON,<a name="ar133" id="ar133"></a></span> a town of northern France, capital of the department
of Aisne, 87 m. N.E. of Paris on the Northern railway. Pop.
(1906), town, 9787, commune (including troops) 15,288. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>190</span>
situated on an isolated ridge, forming two sides of a triangle,
which rises some 330 ft. above the surrounding plain and the
little river of Ardon. The suburbs of St Marcel and Vaux extend
along the foot of the ridge to the north. From the railway
station, situated in the plain to the north, a straight staircase of
several hundred steps leads to the gate of the town, and all the
roads connecting Laon with the surrounding district are cut in
zigzags on the steep slopes, which are crowned by promenades
on the site of the old ramparts. The 13th-century gates of Ardon,
Chenizelles and Soissons, the latter in a state of ruin, have been
preserved. At the eastern extremity of the ridge rises the
citadel; at its apex is the parade-ground of St Martin, and at
the southern end stands the ancient abbey of St Vincent. The
deep depression between the arms of the ridge, known as the
Cuve St Vincent, has its slopes covered with trees, vegetable
gardens and vineyards. From the promenade along the line of
the ramparts there is an extensive view northward beyond St
Quentin, westward to the forest of St Gobain, and southward
over the wooded hills of the Laonnais and Soissonnais.</p>

<p>The cathedral of Laon (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Architecture</a></span>, Romanesque
and Gothic Architecture in France) is one of the most important
creations of the art of the 12th and 13th centuries. It took the
place of the old cathedral, burned at the beginning of the communal
struggles mentioned below. The building is cruciform,
and the choir terminates in a straight wall instead of in an apse.
Of the six towers flanking the façades, only four are complete
to the height of the base of the spires, two at the west front
with <span class="correction" title="amended from hugh">huge</span> figures of oxen beneath the arcades of their upper
portion, and one at each end of the transept. A square central
tower forms a lantern within the church. The west front, with
three porches, the centre one surmounted by a fine rose window,
ranks next to that of Notre-Dame at Paris in purity. The
cathedral has stained glass of the 13th century and a choir grille
of the 18th century. The chapter-house and the cloister contain
beautiful specimens of the architecture of the beginning of the
13th century. The old episcopal palace, contiguous to the
cathedral, is now used as a court-house. The front, flanked by
turrets, is pierced by great pointed windows. There is also a
Gothic cloister and an old chapel of two storeys, of a date anterior
to the cathedral. The church of St Martin dates from the middle
of the 12th century. The old abbey buildings of the same
foundation are now used as the hospital. The museum of Laon
had collections of sculpture and painting. In its garden there
is a chapel of the Templars belonging to the 12th century. The
church of the suburb of Vaux near the railway station dates from
the 11th and 12th centuries. Numerous cellars of two or three
storeys have taken the place of the old quarries in the hill-side.
Laon forms with La Fère and Reims a triangle of important
fortresses. Its fortifications consist of an inner line of works on
the eminence of Laon itself, and two groups of detached forts,
one some 2½ m. S.E. about the village of Bruyères, the other
about 3 m. W.S.W., near Laniscourt. To the S.S.W. forts
Malmaison and Condé connect Laon with the Aisne and with
Reims.</p>

<p>Laon is the seat of a prefect and a court of assizes, and possesses
a tribunal of first instance, a lycée for boys, a college for girls,
a school of agriculture and training colleges. Sugar-making
and metal-founding are carried on, but neither industry nor trade,
which is in grain and wine, are of much importance.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The hilly district of Laon (Laudunum) has always had some
strategic importance. In the time of Caesar there was a Gallic
village where the Remi (inhabitants of the country round Reims)
had to meet the onset of the confederated Belgae. Whatever may
have been the precise locality of that battlefield, Laon was fortified
by the Romans, and successively checked the invasions of the Franks,
Burgundians, Vandals, Alani and Huns. St Remigius, the archbishop
of Reims who baptized Clovis, was born in the Laonnais, and
it was he who, at the end of the 5th century, instituted the bishopric
of the town. Thenceforward Laon was one of the principal towns of
the kingdom of the Franks, and the possession of it was often disputed.
Charles the Bald had enriched its church with the gift of very
numerous domains. After the fall of the Carolingians Laon took the
part of Charles of Lorraine, their heir, and Hugh Capet only succeeded
in making himself master of the town by the connivance of the bishop,
who, in return for this service, was made second ecclesiastical peer
of the kingdom. Early in the 12th century the communes of France
set about emancipating themselves, and the history of the commune
of Laon is one of the richest and most varied. The citizens had
profited by a temporary absence of Bishop Gaudry to secure from his
representatives a communal charter, but he, on his return, purchased
from the king of France the revocation of this document, and recommenced
his oppressions. The consequence was a revolt, in which
the episcopal palace was burnt and the bishop and several of his
partisans were put to death. The fire spread to the cathedral, and
reduced it to ashes. Uneasy at the result of their victory, the rioters
went into hiding outside the town, which was anew pillaged by the
people of the neighbourhood, eager to avenge the death of their
bishop. The king alternately interfered in favour of the bishop and
of the inhabitants till 1239. After that date the liberties of Laon
were no more contested till 1331, when the commune was abolished.
During the Hundred Years&rsquo; War it was attacked and taken by the
Burgundians, who gave it up to the English, to be retaken by the
French after the consecration of Charles VII. Under the League
Laon took the part of the Leaguers, and was taken by Henry IV.
During the campaign of 1814 Napoleon tried in vain to dislodge
Blücher from it. In 1870 an engineer blew up the powder magazine of
the citadel at the moment when the German troops were entering
the town. Many lives were lost; and the cathedral and the old
episcopal palace were damaged. At the Revolution Laon permanently
lost its rank as a bishopric.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAOS<a name="ar134" id="ar134"></a></span>, a territory of French Indo-China, bounded N. by the
Chinese province of Yun-nan, W. by the British Shan states and
Siam, S. by Cambodia and Annam, E. by Annam and N.E. by
Tongking. Northern Laos is traversed by the Mekong (<i>q.v.</i>)
which from Chieng-Khan to a point below Stung-Treng forms the
boundary between Laos (on the left bank) and Siam and Cambodia
(on the right). French Laos constitutes a strip of territory
between 700 and 800 m. in length with an average breadth of
155 m., an approximate area of 88,780 sq. m., and a population
of about 550,000. Its northern region between the Mekong and
Tongking is covered by a tangle of mountain chains clothed with
dense forests and traversed by the Nam-Hou, the Nam-Ta and
other tributaries of the Mekong. The culminating point exceeds
6500 ft. in height. South of this is the extensive wooded plateau
of Tran-Ninh with an average altitude of between 3000 and 5000
ft. Towards the 18th degree of latitude this mountain system
narrows into a range running parallel to and closely approaching
the coast of the China Sea as it descends south. The boundary
between Laos and Annam follows the crest-line of this range,
several peaks of which exceed 6500 ft. (Pu-Atwat, over 8000 ft.).
On the west its ramifications extend to the Mekong enclosing
wide plains watered by the affluents of that river.</p>

<p>Laos is inhabited by a mixed population falling into three
main groups&mdash;the Thais (including the Laotions (see below));
various aboriginal peoples classed as Khas; and the inhabitants
of neighbouring countries, <i>e.g.</i> China, Annam, Cambodia, Siam,
Burma, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Laos has a rainy season lasting from June to October and
corresponding to the S.W. monsoon and a dry season coinciding
with the N.E. monsoon and lasting from November to May.
Both in northern and southern Laos the heat during April and
May is excessive, the thermometer reaching 104° F. and averaging
95° F. With the beginning of the rains the heat becomes more
tolerable. December, January and February are cool months,
the temperature in south Laos (south of 19°) averaging 77°, in
north Laos from 50° to 53°. The plateau of Tran-Ninh and, in
the south, that of the Bolovens are distinguished by the wholesomeness
of their climate.</p>

<p>The forests contain bamboo and many valuable woods amongst
which only the teak of north Laos and rattan are exploited to
any extent; other forest products are rubber, stick lac, gum,
benjamin, cardamoms, &amp;c. Rice and maize, and cotton, indigo,
tobacco, sugar-cane and cardamoms are among the cultivated
plants. Elephants are numerous and the forests are inhabited
by tigers, panthers, bears, deer and buffalo. Hunting and fishing
are leading occupations of the inhabitants. Many species of
monkeys, as well as peacocks, pheasants and woodcock are
found, and the reptiles include crocodiles, turtles, pythons and
cobras.</p>

<p>Scarcity of labour and difficulty of communication hinder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>191</span>
the working of the gold, tin, copper, argentiferous lead, precious
stones and other minerals of the country and the industries in
general are of a primitive kind and satisfy only local needs.</p>

<p>The buffalo, the ox, the horse and the elephant are domesticated,
and these together with cardamoms, rice, tobacco and the
products of the forests form the bulk of the exports. Swine are
reared, their flesh forming an important article of diet. Imports
are inconsiderable, comprising chiefly cotton fabrics, garments
and articles for domestic use. Trade is chiefly in the hands of
the Chinese and is carried on for the most part with Siam. The
Mekong is the chief artery of transit; elsewhere communication
is afforded by tracks sometimes passable only for pedestrians.
Luang-Prabang (<i>q.v.</i>) is the principal commercial town. Before
the French occupation of Laos, it was split up into small principalities
(<i>muongs</i>) of which the chief was that of Vien-Tiane.
Vien-Tiane was destroyed in 1828 by the Siamese who annexed
the territory. In 1893 they made it over to the French, who
grouped the <i>muongs</i> into provinces. Of these there are twelve
each administered by a French commissioner and, under his
surveillance, by native officials elected by the people from
amongst the members of an hereditary nobility. At the head
of the administration there is a resident-superior stationed at
Savannaket. Up till 1896 Laos had no special budget, but was
administered by Cochin-China, Annam and Tongking. The
budget for 1899 showed receipts £78,988 and expenditure
£77,417. For 1904 the budget figures were, receipts £82,942,
expenditure £76,344. The chief sources of revenue are the direct
taxes (£15,606 in 1904), especially the poll-tax, and the contribution
from the general budget of Indo-China (£54,090 in 1904).
The chief items of expenditure in 1904 were Government house,
&amp;c., £22,558, transport, £19,191, native guard, £17,327.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAOS<a name="ar135" id="ar135"></a></span>, or <span class="sc">Laotions</span>, an important division of the widespread
Thai or Shan race found throughout Indo-China from 28° N.
and the sources of the Irrawaddy as far as Cambodia and 7° N.
in the Malay Peninsula. This Thai family includes the Shans
proper, and the Siamese. The name Lao, which appears to
mean simply &ldquo;man,&rdquo; is the collective Siamese term for all the
Thai peoples subject to Siam, while Shan, said to be of Chinese
origin, is the collective Burmese term for those subject to Burma.
Lao is therefore rather a political than an ethnical title, and the
people cordially dislike the name, insisting on their right to be
called Thai. Owing to the different circumstances which have
attended their migrations, the Thai peoples have attained to
varying degrees of civilization. The Lao, who descended from
the mountain districts of Yunnan, Szechuen and Kweichow to
the highland plains of upper Indo-China, and drove the wilder
Kha peoples whom they found in possession into the hills,
mostly adopted Buddhism, and formed small settled communities
or states in which laws were easy, taxes light and a very fair
degree of comfort was attained. There are two main divisions,
the Lao Pong Dam (&ldquo;Black Paunch Laos&rdquo;), so-called from their
habit of tattooing the body from the waist to the knees, and the
Lao Pong Kao (&ldquo;White Paunch Laos&rdquo;) who do not tattoo.
Lao tattooing is of a most elaborate kind. The Lao Pong Dam
now form the western branch of the Lao family, inhabiting the
Siamese Lao states of Chieng Mai Lapaun, &lsquo;Tern Pre and Nan,
and reaching as far south as 17° N. Various influences have
contributed to making the Lao the pleasant, easy-going, idle
fellow that he is. The result is that practically all the trade of
these states is in the hands of Bangkok Chinese firms, of a certain
number of European houses and others, while most of the manual
labour connected with the teak industry is done by Ka Mus,
who migrate in large numbers from the left bank of the Mekong.
The Lao Pong Kao, or eastern branch, appear to have migrated
southwards by the more easterly route of the Nam-u and the
Mekong valley. In contradistinction to the Lao Pong Dam, who
have derived their written language from the Burmese character,
the eastern race has retained what appears to be the early form of
the present Siamese writing, from which it differs little. They
formed important settlements at various points on the Mekong,
notably Luang Prabang, Wieng Chan (Vien-Tiane) Ubon and
Bassac; and, heading inland as far as Korat on the one side
and the Annamite watershed in the east, they drove out the
less civilized Kha peoples, and even the Cambodians, as the Lao
Pong Dam did on the west. Vien-Tiane during the 18th century
was the most powerful of the Lao principalities, and was feared
and respected throughout Indo-China. It was destroyed by the
Siamese in 1828. The inhabitants, in accordance with the Indo-Chinese
custom of the day, were transported to Lower Siam. The
Lao Pong Kao below 18° N. are a less merry and less vivacious
people, and are for the most part shorter and more thick-set
than those of Luang Prabang and the north. If possible, they
are as a race lazier than the western Lao, as they are certainly
more musical. The &ldquo;khen,&rdquo; or mouth organ, which is universal
among them, is the sweetest-toned of eastern instruments.</p>

<p>After 1828 the Laos became entirely subject to Siam, and were
governed partly by khiao, or native hereditary princes, partly
by mandarins directly nominated by the Bangkok authorities.
The khiao were invested by a gold dish, betel-box, spittoon and
teapot, which were sent from Bangkok and returned at their
death or deposition. Of all the khiao the most powerful was the
prince of Ubon (15° N., 105° E.), whose jurisdiction extended
nearly from Bassac on the Mekong northwards to the great
southern bend of that river. Nearly all the Laos country is now
divided between France and Siam, and only a few tribes retain
a nominal independence.</p>

<p>The many contradictory accounts of the Laos are due to the
fact that the race has become much mixed with the aboriginal
inhabitants. The half-castes sprung from alliances with the wild
tribes of Caucasic stock present every variety between that type
and the Mongolian. But the pure Laos are still distinguished
by the high cheek-bones, small flat nose, oblique eyes, wide
mouth, black lank hair, sparse beard, and yellow complexion of
the Thai and other branches of the Mongol family. In disposition
the Laos are an apathetic, peace-loving, pleasant-mannered
race. Though the women have to work, they are
free and well treated, and polygamy is rare. The Laos are very
superstitious, believe in wer-wolves, and that all diseases are
caused by evil spirits. Their chief food is rice and fish. Men,
women and children all smoke tobacco. The civilized Laos were
long addicted to slave-hunting, not only with the sanction but
even with the co-operation of their rulers, the Lao mandarins
heading regular expeditions against the wilder tribes.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Closely allied with the Lao are a number of tribes found throughout
the hill regions of the upper Mekong, between Yunnan and Kwangsi
in China and the upper waters of the Menam in Siam. They have all
within recent times been partakers in the general movement towards
the south-west from the highland districts of southern China, which
has produced so many recruits for the peopling of the Indo-Chinese
peninsula. Of this group of people, among whom may be named the
Yao, Yao Yin, Lanten, Meo, Musur (or Muhso) and Kaw, perhaps the
best known and most like the Lao are the Lu&mdash;both names meaning
originally &ldquo;man&rdquo;&mdash;who have in many cases adopted a form of
Buddhism (flavoured strongly by their natural respect for local
spirits as well as tattooing) and other relatively civilized customs,
and have forsaken their wandering life among the hills for a more
settled village existence. Hardy, simple and industrious, fond of
music, kind-hearted, and with a strangely artistic taste in dress,
these people possess in a wonderful degree the secret of cheerful
contentment.</p>

&ldquo;the Old Boy,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Old Philosopher.&rdquo; The latter significance
is attached to them by Dr Chalmers in his translation of
the treatise published in 1868 under the title of <i>The Speculations
on Metaphysics, Polity and Morality of &ldquo;the Old Philosopher,&rdquo;
Lâo-tsze</i>. The former is derived from a fabulous account of
Lâo-tsze in the <i>Sh&#259;n Hsien Chwan</i>; &ldquo;The Account of Spirits
and Immortals,&rdquo; of Ko Hung in the 4th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> According
to this, his mother, after a supernatural conception, carried him
in her womb sixty-two years (or seventy-two, or eighty-one&mdash;ten
years more or fewer are of little importance in such a case), so
that, when he was born at last, his hair was white as with age,
and people might well call him &ldquo;the old boy.&rdquo; The other
meaning of the designation rests on better authority. We
find it in the <i>Kiâ Yü</i>, or &ldquo;Narratives of the Confucian School,&rdquo;
compiled in the 3rd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> from documents said to have
been preserved among the descendants of Confucius, and also in
the brief history of Lâo-tsze given in the historical records of
Sze-ma Ch&rsquo;ien (about 100 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). In the latter instance the
designation is used by Confucius, and possibly it originated with
him. It should be regarded more as an epithet of respect than
of years, and is equivalent to &ldquo;the Venerable Philosopher.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>All that Ch&rsquo;ien tells us about Lâo-tsze goes into small compass.
His surname was Lî, and his name Urh. He was a native of the state
of Ch&rsquo;û, and was born in a hamlet not far from the present prefectural
city of Kwei-te in Ho-nan province. He was one of the recorders or
historiographers at the court of Chow, his special department being
the charge of the whole or a portion of the royal library. He must
thus have been able to make himself acquainted with the history of
his country. Ch&rsquo;ien does not mention the year of his birth, which is
often said, though on what Chinese authority does not appear, to
have taken place in the third year of King Phing, corresponding to
604 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> That date cannot be far from the truth. That he was
contemporary with Confucius is established by the concurrent
testimony of the <i>Lî Kî</i> and the <i>Kiâ Yü</i> on the Confucian side, and of
Chwang-tsze and Sze-ma Ch&rsquo;ien on the Tâoist. The two men whose
influence has been so great on all the subsequent generations of the
Chinese people&mdash;Kung-tsze (Confucius) and Lâo-tsze&mdash;had at least
one interview, in 517 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, when the former was in his thirty-fifth
year. The conversation between them was interesting. Lâo was in
a mocking mood; Kung appears to the greater advantage. If it be
true that Confucius, when he was fifty-one years old, visited Lâo-tsze
as Chwang-tsze says (in the <i>Thien Yun</i>, the fourteenth of his treatises),
to ask about the <i>Tâo</i>, they must have had more than one interview.
Dr Chalmers, however, has pointed out that both Chwang-tsze and
Lieh-tsze (a still earlier Tâoist writer) produce Confucius in their
writings, as the lords of the Philistines did the captive Samson on
their festive occasions, &ldquo;to make sport for them.&rdquo; Their testimony
is valueless as to any matter of fact. There may have been several
meetings between the two in 517 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, but we have no evidence that
they were together in the same place after that time. Ch&rsquo;ien
adds:&mdash;&ldquo;Lâo-tsze cultivated the <i>Tâo</i> and virtue, his chief aim in his studies
being how to keep himself concealed and unknown. He resided at
(the capital of) Chow; but after a long time, seeing the decay of the
dynasty, he left it, and went away to the Gate (leading from the
royal domain into the regions beyond&mdash;at the entrance of the pass
of Han-kû, in the north-west of Ho-nan). Yin Hsî, the warden of
the Gate, said to him, &lsquo;You are about to withdraw yourself out of
sight; I pray you to compose for me a book (before you go).&rsquo; On
this Lâo-tsze made a writing, setting forth his views on the <i>tâo</i>
and virtue, in two sections, containing more than 5000 characters.
He then went away, and it is not known where he died.&rdquo; The
historian then mentions the names of two other men whom some
regarded as the true Lâo-tsze. One of them was a Lâo Lâi, a contemporary
of Confucius, who wrote fifteen treatises (or sections) on
the practices of the school of <i>Tâo</i>. Subjoined to the notice of him is
the remark that Lâo-tsze was more than one hundred and sixty
years old, or, as some say, more than two hundred, because by the
cultivation of the <i>Tâo</i> he nourished his longevity. The other was &ldquo;a
grand historiographer&rdquo; of Chow, called Tan, one hundred and
twenty-nine (? one hundred and nineteen) years after the death of
Confucius. The introduction of these disjointed notices detracts
from the verisimilitude of the whole narrative in which they occur.</p>

<p>Finally, Ch&rsquo;ien states that &ldquo;Lâo-tsze was a superior man, who liked
to keep in obscurity,&rdquo; traces the line of his posterity down to the
2nd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and concludes with this important statement:&mdash;&ldquo;Those
who attach themselves to the doctrine of Lâo-tsze condemn
that of the literati, and the literati on their part condemn Lâo-tsze,
thus verifying the saying, &lsquo;Parties whose principles are different
cannot take counsel together.&rsquo; Lî Urh taught that transformation
follows, as a matter of course, the doing nothing (to bring it about),
and rectification ensues in the same way from being pure and still.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Accepting the <i>Tâo Teh King</i> as the veritable work of Lâo-tsze,
we may now examine its contents. Consisting of not more than
between five and six thousand characters, it is but a short
treatise&mdash;not half the size of the Gospel of St Mark. The nature
of the subject, however, the want of any progress of thought or
of logical connexion between its different parts, and the condensed
style, with the mystic tendencies and poetical temperament of
the author, make its meaning extraordinarily obscure. Divided
at first into two parts, it has subsequently and conveniently
been subdivided into chapters. One of the oldest, and the most
common, of these arrangements makes the chapters eighty-two.</p>

<p>Some Roman Catholic missionaries, two centuries ago, fancied
that they found a wonderful harmony between many passages
and the teaching of the Bible. Montucci of Berlin
ventured to say in 1808: &ldquo;Many things about a
<span class="sidenote">Supposed harmony with Biblical teaching.</span>
Triune God are so clearly expressed that no one who
has read this book can doubt that the mystery of the
Holy Trinity was revealed to the Chinese five centuries
before the coming of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Even Rémusat, the first
occupant of a Chinese chair in Europe, published at Paris in
1823 his <i>Mémoire sur la vie et les opinions de Lâo-tsze</i>, to
vindicate the view that the Hebrew name Yahweh was phonetically
represented in the fourteenth chapter by Chinese characters.
These fancies were exploded by Stanislas Julien, when he issued
in 1842 his translation of the whole treatise as <i>Le Livre de la
voie et de la vertu</i>.</p>

<p>The most important thing is to determine what we are to
understand by the <i>Tâo</i>, for <i>Teh</i> is merely its outcome, especially
in man, and is rightly translated by &ldquo;virtue.&rdquo; Julien translated
<i>Tâo</i> by &ldquo;la voie.&rdquo; Chalmers leaves it untranslated. &ldquo;No
English word,&rdquo; he says (p. xi.), &ldquo;is its exact equivalent. Three
terms suggest themselves&mdash;the way, reason and the word;
but they are all liable to objection. Were we guided by etymology,
&lsquo;the way&rsquo; would come nearest the original, and in one
or two passages the idea of a way seems to be in the term; but
this is too materialistic to serve the purpose of a translation.
&lsquo;Reason,&rsquo; again, seems to be more like a quality or attribute of
some conscious being than <i>Tâo</i> is. I would translate it by
&lsquo;the Word,&rsquo; in the sense of the Logos, but this would be like
settling the question which I wish to leave open, viz. what
resemblance there is between the Logos of the New Testament
and this Chinese Tâo.&rdquo; Later Sinologues in China have employed
&ldquo;nature&rdquo; as our best analogue of the term. Thus Watters
(<i>Lâo-tsze, A Study in Chinese Philosophy</i>, p. 45) says:&mdash;&ldquo;In
the <i>Tâo Teh King</i> the originator of the universe is referred to
under the names Non-Existence, Existence, Nature (<i>Tâo</i>) and
various designations&mdash;all which, however, represent one idea
in various manifestations. It is in all cases Nature (<i>Tâo</i>) which
is meant.&rdquo; This view has been skilfully worked out; but it only
hides the scope of &ldquo;the Venerable Philosopher.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nature&rdquo;
cannot be accepted as a <i>translation</i> of <i>Tâo</i>. That character was,
primarily, the symbol of a way, road or path; and then, figuratively,
it was used, as we also use <i>way</i>, in the senses of means and
method&mdash;the <i>course</i> that we pursue in passing from one thing
or concept to another as its end or result. It is the name of a
quality. Sir Robert Douglas has well said (<i>Confucianism and
Tâoism</i>, p. 189): &ldquo;If we were compelled to adopt a single
word to represent the <i>Tâo</i> of Lâo-tsze, we should prefer the sense
in which it is used by Confucius, &lsquo;the way,&rsquo; that is, <span class="grk" title="methodos">&#956;&#941;&#952;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#962;</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What, then, was the quality which Lâo-tsze had in view, and
which he thought of as the <i>Tâo</i>&mdash;there in the library of Chow,
at the pass of the valley of Han, and where he met
the end of his life beyond the limits of the civilized
<span class="sidenote">The doctrine of &ldquo;the way.&rdquo;</span>
state? It was the simplicity of spontaneity, action
(which might be called non-action) without motive,
free from all selfish purpose, resting in nothing but its own
accomplishment. This is found in the phenomena of the material
world. &ldquo;All things spring up without a word spoken, and grow
without a claim for their production. They go through their
processes without any display of pride in them; and the results
are realized without any assumption of ownership. It is owing
to the absence of such assumption that the results and their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>193</span>
processes do not disappear&rdquo; (chap. ii.). It only needs the same
quality in the arrangements and measures of government to
make society beautiful and happy. &ldquo;A government conducted
by sages would free the hearts of the people from inordinate
desires, fill their bellies, keep their ambitions feeble and strengthen
their bones. They would constantly keep the people without
knowledge and free from desires; and, where there were those
who had knowledge, they would have them so that they would
not dare to put it in practice&rdquo; (chap. iii.). A corresponding
course observed by individual man in his government of himself
becoming again &ldquo;as a little child&rdquo; (chaps. x. and xxviii.) will
have corresponding results. &ldquo;His constant virtue will be
complete, and he will return to the primitive simplicity&rdquo;
(chap. xxviii.).</p>

<p>Such is the subject matter of the <i>Tâo Teh King</i>&mdash;the operation
of this method or <i>Tâo</i>, &ldquo;without striving or crying,&rdquo; in nature,
in society and in the individual. Much that is very beautiful
and practical is inculcated in connexion with its working in the
individual character. The writer seems to feel that he cannot
say enough on the virtue of humility (chap. viii., &amp;c.). There
were three things which he prized and held fast&mdash;gentle compassion,
economy and the not presuming to take precedence
in the world (chap. lxvii.). His teaching rises to its highest
point in chap. lxiii.:&mdash;&ldquo;It is the way of <i>Tâo</i> not to act from
any personal motive, to conduct affairs without feeling the
trouble of them, to taste without being aware of the flavour, to
account the great as small and the small as great, to recompense
injury with kindness.&rdquo; This last and noblest characteristic
of the <i>Tâo</i>, the requiting &ldquo;good for evil,&rdquo; is not touched on again
in the treatise; but we know that it excited general attention
at the time, and was the subject of conversation between
Confucius and his disciples (<i>Confucian Analects</i>, xiv. 36).</p>

<p>What is said in the <i>Tâo</i> on government is not, all of it, so
satisfactory. The writer shows, indeed, the benevolence of
his heart. He seems to condemn the infliction of capital punishment
(chaps. lxxiii. and lxxiv.), and he deplores the practice
of war (chap. lxix.); but he had no sympathy with the progress
of society or with the culture and arts of life. He says (chap.
lxv.):&mdash;&ldquo;Those who anciently were skilful in practising the <i>Tâo</i>
did not use it to enlighten the people; their object rather was
to keep them simple. The difficulty in governing the people
arises from their having too much knowledge, and therefore he
who tries to govern a state by wisdom is a scourge to it, while
he who does not try to govern thereby is a blessing.&rdquo; The last
chapter but one is the following:&mdash;&ldquo;In a small state with a few
inhabitants, I would so order it that the people, though supplied
with all kinds of implements, would not (care to) use them;
I would give them cause to look on death as a most grievous
thing, while yet they would not go away to a distance to escape
from it. Though they had boats and carriages, they should
have no occasion to ride in them. Though they had buff-coats
and sharp weapons, they should not don or use them. I would
make them return to the use of knotted cords (instead of written
characters). They should think their coarse food sweet, their
plain clothing beautiful, their poor houses places of rest and their
common simple ways sources of enjoyment. There should be
a neighbouring state within sight, and the sound of the fowls
and dogs should be heard from it to us without interruption,
but I would make the people to old age, even to death, have no
intercourse with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On reading these sentiments, we must judge of Lâo-tsze
that, with all his power of thought, he was only a dreamer.
But thus far there is no difficulty arising from his language
in regard to the <i>Tâo</i>. It is simply a quality, descriptive of the
style of character and action, which the individual should seek
to attain in himself, and the ruler to impress on his administration.
The language about the <i>Tâo</i> in nature is by no means so clear.
While Sir Robert Douglas says that &ldquo;the way&rdquo; would be the
best translation of <i>Tâo</i>, he immediately adds:&mdash;&ldquo;But <i>Tâo</i> is
more than the way. It is the way and the way-goer. It is an
eternal road; along it all beings and things walk; but no being
made it, for it is being itself; it is everything, and nothing
and the cause and effect of all. All things originate from <i>Tâo</i>,
conform to <i>Tâo</i> and to <i>Tâo</i> at last they return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some of these representations require modification; but no
thoughtful reader of the treatise can fail to be often puzzled
by what is said on the point in hand. Julien, indeed,
says with truth (p. xiii.) that &ldquo;it is impossible to take
<span class="sidenote">The Tâo and the Deity.</span>
<i>Tâo</i> for the primordial Reason, for the sublime Intelligence,
which has created and governs the world&rdquo;;
but many of Lâo-tsze&rsquo;s statements are unthinkable if there
be not behind the <i>Tâo</i> the unexpressed recognition of a personal
creator and ruler. Granted that he does not affirm positively
the existence of such a Being, yet certainly he does not deny
it, and his language even implies it. It has been said, indeed,
that he denies it, and we are referred in proof to the fourth
chapter:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Tâo</i> is like the emptiness of a vessel; and the use
of it, we may say, must be free from all self-sufficiency. How
deep and mysterious it is, as if it were the author of all things!
We should make our sharpness blunt, and unravel the complications
of things; we should attemper our brightness, and
assimilate ourselves to the obscurity caused by dust. How still
and clear is <i>Tâo</i>, a phantasm with the semblance of permanence!
I do not know whose son it is. It might appear to have been
before God (<i>Ti</i>).&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reader will not overlook the cautious and dubious manner
in which the predicates of <i>Tâo</i> are stated in this remarkable
passage. The author does not say that it was before God,
but that &ldquo;it might appear&rdquo; to have been so. Nowhere else
in his treatise does the nature of <i>Tâo</i> as a method or style of
action come out more clearly. It has no positive existence of
itself; it is but like the emptiness of a vessel, and the manifestation
of it by men requires that they endeavour to free themselves
from all self-sufficiency. Whence came it? It does not shock
Lâo-tsze to suppose that it had a father, but he cannot tell
whose son it is. And, as the feeling of its mysteriousness grows
on him, he ventures to say that &ldquo;it might appear to have been
before God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is here no denial but express recognition of the existence
of God, so far as it is implied in the name <i>Tî</i>, which is the personal
name for the concept of heaven as the ruling power, by means
of which the fathers of the Chinese people rose in prehistoric
time to the idea of God. Again and again Lâo-tsze speaks of
heaven just as &ldquo;we do when we mean thereby the Deity who
presides over heaven and earth.&rdquo; These last words are taken
from Watters (p. 81); and, though he adds, &ldquo;We must not forget
that this heaven is inferior and subsequent to the mysterious
<i>Tâo</i>, and was in fact produced by it,&rdquo; it has been shown how
rash and unwarranted is the ascription of such a sentiment to
&ldquo;the Venerable Philosopher.&rdquo; He makes the <i>Tâo</i> prior to heaven
and earth, which is a phrase denoting what we often call &ldquo;nature,&rdquo;
but he does not make it prior to heaven in the higher and immaterial
usage of that name. The last sentence of his treatise
is:&mdash;&ldquo;It is the <i>Tâo</i>&mdash;the way&mdash;of Heaven to benefit and not
injure; it is the <i>Tâo</i>&mdash;the way&mdash;of the sage to do and not
strive.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Since Julien laid the <i>Tâo Teh King</i> fairly open to Western readers
in 1842, there has been a tendency to overestimate rather than to
underestimate its value as a scheme of thought and a discipline for
the individual and society. There are in it lessons of unsurpassed
value, such as the inculcation of simplicity, humility and self-abnegation,
and especially the brief enunciation of the divine duty
of returning good for ill; but there are also the regretful representations
of a primitive society when men were ignorant of the rudiments
of culture, and the longings for its return.</p>

<p>When it was thought that the treatise made known the doctrine
of the Trinity, and even gave a phonetic representation of the
Hebrew name for God, it was natural, even necessary, to believe
that its author had had communication with more western parts of
Asia, and there was much speculation about visits to India and
Judaea, and even to Greece. The necessity for assuming such
travels has passed away. If we can receive Sze-mâ Ch&rsquo;ien&rsquo;s histories
as trustworthy, Lâo-tsze might have heard, in the states of Chow
and among the wild tribes adjacent to them, views about society
and government very like his own. Ch&rsquo;ien relates how an envoy
came in 624 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>&mdash;twenty years before the date assigned to the birth
of Lâo-tsze&mdash;to the court of Duke Mû of Ch&rsquo;in, sent by the king of
some rude hordes on the west. The duke told him of the histories,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>194</span>
poems, codes of rites, music and laws which they had in the middle
states, while yet rebellion and disorder were of frequent occurrence,
and asked how good order was secured among the wild people, who
had none of those appliances. The envoy smiled, and replied that
the troubles of China were occasioned by those very things of which
the duke vaunted, and that there had been a gradual degeneration
in the condition of its states, as their professed civilization had
increased, ever since the days of the ancient sage, Hwang Tî, whereas
in the land he came from, where there was nothing but the primitive
simplicity, their princes showed a pure virtue in their treatment of
the people, who responded to them with loyalty and good faith.
&ldquo;The government of a state,&rdquo; said he in conclusion, &ldquo;is like a man&rsquo;s
ruling his own single person. He rules it, and does not know how
he does so; and this was indeed the method of the sages.&rdquo; Lâo-tsze
did not need to go further afield to find all that he has said about
government.</p>

<p>We have confined ourselves to the Tâoism of the <i>Tâo Teh King</i>
without touching on the religion Tâoism now existing in China, but
which did not take shape until more than five hundred
years after the death of Lâo-tsze, though he now occupies
<span class="sidenote">The Tâoism of to-da.</span>
the second place in its trinity of &ldquo;The three Pure or Holy
Ones.&rdquo; There is hardly a word in his treatise that savours
either of superstition or religion. In the works of Lieh-tsze and
Chwang-tsze, his earliest followers of note, we find abundance of
grotesque superstitions; but their beliefs (if indeed we can say that
they had beliefs) had not become embodied in any religious institutions.
When we come to the Ch&rsquo;in dynasty (221-206 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), we meet
with a Tâoism in the shape of a search for the fairy islands of the
eastern sea, where the herb of immortality might be gathered. In
the 1st century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> a magician, called Chang Tâo-ling, comes before
us as the chief professor and controller of this Tâoism, preparing in
retirement &ldquo;the pill&rdquo; which renewed his youth, supreme over all
spirits, and destroying millions of demons by a stroke of his pencil.
He left his books, talismans and charms, with his sword and seal,
to his descendants, and one of them, professing to be animated by his
soul, dwells on the Lung-hû mountain in Kiang-si, the acknowledged
head or pope of Tâoism. But even then the system was not yet a
religion, with temples or monasteries, liturgies and forms of public
worship. It borrowed all these from Buddhism, which first obtained
public recognition in China between <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 65 and 70, though at least a
couple of centuries passed before it could be said to have free course
in the country.</p>

<p>Even still, with the form of a religion, Tâoism is in reality a
conglomeration of base and dangerous superstitions. Alchemy,
geomancy and spiritualism have dwelt and dwell under its shadow.
Each of its &ldquo;three Holy Ones&rdquo; has the title of <i>Thien Tsun</i>, &ldquo;the
Heavenly and Honoured,&rdquo; taken from Buddhism, and also of <i>Shang
Ti</i> or God, taken from the old religion of the country. The most
popular deity, however, is not one of them, but has the title of <i>Yü
Wang Shang Tî</i>, &ldquo;God, the Perfect King.&rdquo; But it would take long
to tell of all its &ldquo;celestial gods,&rdquo; &ldquo;great gods,&rdquo; &ldquo;divine rulers&rdquo; and
others. It has been doubted whether Lâo-tsze acknowledged the
existence of God at all, but modern Tâoism is a system of the
wildest polytheism. The science and religion of the West meet from
it a most determined opposition. The &ldquo;Venerable Philosopher&rdquo;
himself would not have welcomed them; but he ought not to bear
the obloquy of being the founder of the Tâoist religion.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA PAZ,<a name="ar137" id="ar137"></a></span> a western department of Bolivia, bounded N. by
the national territories of Caupolican and El Beni, E. by El
Beni and Cochabamba, S. by Cochabamba and Oruro and W.
by Chile and Peru. Pop. (1900) 445,616, the majority of whom
are Indians. Area 53,777 sq. m. The department belongs to
the great Bolivian plateau, and its greater part to the cold,
bleak, <i>puna</i> climatic region. The Cordillera Real crosses it
N.W. to S.E. and culminates in the snow-crowned summits of
Sorata and Illimani. The west of the department includes
a part of the Titicaca basin with about half of the lake. This
elevated plateau region is partially barren and inhospitable,
its short, cold summers permitting the production of little besides
potatoes, quinoa (<i>Chenopodium quinoa</i>) and barley, with a
little Indian corn and wheat in favoured localities. Some attention
is given to the rearing of llamas, and a few cattle, sheep
and mules are to be seen south of Lake Titicaca. There is a
considerable Indian population in this region, living chiefly in
small hamlets on the products of their own industry. In the
lower valleys of the eastern slopes, where climatic conditions
range from temperate to tropical, wheat, Indian corn, oats and
the fruits and vegetables of the temperate zone are cultivated.
Farther down, coffee, cacao, coca, rice, sugar cane, tobacco,
oranges, bananas and other tropical fruits are grown, and the
forests yield cinchona bark and rubber. The mineral wealth
of La Paz includes gold, silver, tin, copper and bismuth. Tin
and copper are the most important of these, the principal tin
mines being in the vicinity of the capital and known under the
names of Huayna-Potosi, Milluni and Chocoltaga. The chief
copper mines are the famous Corocoro group, about 75 m.
S.S.E. of Lake Titicaca by the Desaguadero river, the principal
means of transport. The output of the Corocoro mines, which
also includes gold and silver, finds its way to market by boat and
rail to Mollendo, and by pack animals to Tacna and rail to Arica.
There are no roads in La Paz worthy of the name except the
5 m. between the capital and the &ldquo;Alto,&rdquo; though stagecoach
communication with Oruro and Chililaya has been maintained
by the national government. The railway opened in
1905 between Guaqui and La Paz (54 m.) superseded the latter
of these stage lines, and a railway is planned from Viacha to
Oruro to supersede the other. The capital of the department is
the national capital La Paz. Corocoro, near the Desaguadero
river, about 75 m. S.S.E. of Lake Titicaca and 13,353 ft. above
sea-level, has an estimated population (1906) of 15,000, chiefly
Aymará Indians.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LA PAZ<a name="ar138" id="ar138"></a></span> (officially <span class="sc">La Paz de Ayacucho</span>), the capital of
Bolivia since 1898, the see of a bishopric created in 1605 and
capital of the department of La Paz, on the Rio de la Paz or
Rio Chuquiapo, 42 m. S.E. of Lake Titicaca (port of Chililaya)
in 16° 30&prime; S., 68° W. Pop. (1900) 54,713, (1906, estimate)
67,235. The city is built in a deeply-eroded valley of the
Cordillera Real which is believed to have formed an outlet of
Lake Titicaca, and at this point descends sharply to the S.E.,
the river making a great bend southward and then flowing
northward to the Beni. The valley is about 10 m. long and 3 m.
wide, and is singularly barren and forbidding. Its precipitous
sides, deeply gullied by torrential rains and diversely coloured
by mineral ores, rise 1500 ft. above the city to the margin of
the great plateau surrounding Lake Titicaca, and above these
are the snow-capped summits of Illimani and other giants of
the Bolivian Cordillera. Below, the valley is fertile and covered
with vegetation, first of the temperate and then of the tropical
zone. The elevation of La Paz is 12,120 ft. above sea-level,
which places it within the <i>puna</i> climatic region, in which the
summers are short and cold. The mean annual temperature
is a little above the <i>puna</i> average, which is 54° F., the extremes
ranging from 19° to 75°. Pneumonia and bronchial complaints
are common, but consumption is said to be rare. The surface
of the valley is very uneven, rising sharply from the river on
both sides, and the transverse streets of the city are steep and
irregular. At its south-eastern extremity is the Alameda, a
handsome public promenade with parallel rows of exotic trees,
shrubs and flowers, which are maintained with no small effort
in so inhospitable a climate. The trees which seem to thrive
best are the willow and eucalyptus. The streets are generally
narrow and roughly paved, and there are numerous bridges across
the river and its many small tributaries. The dwellings of the
poorer classes are commonly built with mud walls and covered
with tiles, but stone and brick are used for the better structures.
The cathedral, which was begun in the 17th century when the
mines of Potosi were at the height of their productiveness, was
never finished because of the revolutions and the comparative
poverty of the city under the republic. It faces the Plaza
Mayor and is distinguished for the finely-carved stonework of
its façade. Facing the same plaza are the government offices
and legislative chambers. Other notable edifices and institutions
are the old university of San Andrés, the San Francisco church,
a national college, a seminary, a good public library and a
museum rich in relics of the Inca and colonial periods. La
Paz is an important commercial centre, being connected with
the Pacific coast by the Peruvian railway from Mollendo to
Puno (via Arequipa), and a Bolivian extension from Guaqui to
the Alto de La Paz (Heights of La Paz)&mdash;the two lines being
connected by a steamship service across Lake Titicaca. An
electric railway 5 m. long connects the Alto de La Paz with the
city, 1493 ft. below. This route is 496 m. long, and is expensive
because of trans-shipments and the cost of handling cargo at
Mollendo. The vicinity of La Paz abounds with mineral wealth;
most important are the tin deposits of Huayna-Potosi, Milluni
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>195</span>
and Chocoltaga. The La Paz valley is auriferous, and since the
foundation of the city gold has been taken from the soil washed
down from the mountain sides.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>La Paz was founded in 1548 by Alonzo de Mendoza on the site
of an Indian village called Chuquiapu. It was called the Pueblo
Nuevo de Nuestra Señora de la Paz in commemoration of the reconciliation
between Pizarro and Almagro, and soon became an important
colony. At the close of the war of independence (1825) it
was rechristened La Paz de Ayacucho, in honour of the last decisive
battle of that protracted struggle. It was made one of the four
capitals of the republic, but the revolution of 1898 permanently
established the seat of government here because of its accessibility,
wealth, trade and political influence.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA PÉROUSE, JEAN-FRANÇOIS DE GALAUP<a name="ar139" id="ar139"></a></span>, <span class="sc">Comte de</span>
(1741-<i>c.</i> 1788), French navigator, was born near Albi, on the
22nd of August 1741. His family name was Galaup, and La
Pérouse or La Peyrouse was an addition adopted by himself
from a small family estate near Albi. As a lad of eighteen he was
wounded and made prisoner on board the &ldquo;Formidable&rdquo; when
it was captured by Admiral Hawke in 1759; and during the
war with England between 1778 and 1783 he served with distinction
in various parts of the world, more particularly on the
eastern coasts of Canada and in Hudson&rsquo;s Bay, where he captured
Forts Prince of Wales and York (August 8th and 21st, 1782).
In 1785 (August 1st) he sailed from Brest in command of the
French government expedition of two vessels (&ldquo;La Boussole&rdquo;
under La Pérouse himself, and &ldquo;L&rsquo;Astrolabe,&rdquo; under de Langle)
for the discovery of the North-West Passage, vainly essayed by
Cook on his last voyage, from the Pacific side. He was also
charged with the further exploration of the north-west coasts of
America, and the north-east coasts of Asia, of the China and Japan
seas, the Solomon Islands and Australia; and he was ordered
to collect information as to the whale fishery in the southern
oceans and as to the fur trade in North America. He reached
Mount St Elias, on the coast of Alaska, on the 23rd of June
1786. After six weeks, marked by various small discoveries,
he was driven from these regions by bad weather; and after
visiting the Hawaiian Islands, and discovering Necker Island
(November 5th, 1786), he crossed over to Asia (Macao, January
3rd, 1787). Thence he passed to the Philippines, and so to the
coasts of Japan, Korea and &ldquo;Chinese Tartary,&rdquo; where his best
results were gained. Touching at Quelpart, he reached De
Castries Bay, near the modern Vladivostok, on the 28th of July
1787; and on the 2nd of August following discovered the
strait, still named after him, between Sakhalin and the Northern
Island of Japan. On the 7th of September he put in at Petropavlovsk
in Kamchatka, where he was well received by special
order of the Russian empress, Catherine II.; thence he sent
home Lesseps, overland, with the journals, notes, plans and maps
recording the work of the expedition. He left Avacha Bay on
the 29th of September, and arrived at Mauna in the Samoan
group on the 8th of December; here de Langle and ten of the
crew of the &ldquo;Astrolabe&rdquo; were murdered. He quitted Samoa
on the 14th of December, touched at the Friendly Islands and
Norfolk Island and arrived in Botany Bay on the 26th of January
1788. From this place, where he interchanged courtesies with
some of the English pioneers in Australia, he wrote his last letter
to the French Ministry of Marine (February 7th). After this
no more was heard of him and his squadron till in 1826 Captain
Peter Dillon found the wreckage of what must have been the
&ldquo;Boussole&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Astrolabe&rdquo; on the reefs of Vanikoro,
an island to the north of the New Hebrides. In 1828 Dumont
d&rsquo;Urville visited the scene of the disaster and erected a monument
(March 14th).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAPIDARY<a name="ar140" id="ar140"></a></span>, and <span class="bold">GEM CUTTING</span> (Lat. <i>lapidarius, lapis</i>, a
stone). The earliest examples of gem cutting and carving
known (see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gem</a></span>) are the ancient engraved seals, which are
of two principal types, the cylindrical or &ldquo;rolling&rdquo; seals of
Babylonia and Assyria, suggested by a joint of the bamboo or
the central whorl of a conch-like shell, and the peculiar scarabaeoid
seals of Egypt. Recent researches make it appear that
both these types were in use as far back as 4500 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, though with
some variations. The jewels of Queen Zer, and other jewels
consisting of cut turquoise, lapis lazuli and amethyst, found by
the French mission, date from 4777 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> to 4515 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Until
about 2500 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, the cylinder seals bore almost wholly animal
designs; then cuneiform inscriptions were added. In the 6th
century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, the scarabaeoid type was introduced from Egypt,
while the rolling seals began to give place to a new form, that
of a tall cone. These, in a century or two, were gradually
shortened; the hole by which they were suspended was enlarged
until it could admit the finger, and in time they passed into the
familiar form of seal-rings. This later type, which prevailed
for a long period, usually bore Persian or Sassanian inscriptions.
The scarabaeoid seals were worn as rings in Egypt apparently
from the earliest times.</p>

<p>The most ancient of the cylinder seals were cut at first from
shell, then largely from opaque stones such as diorite and
serpentine. After 2500 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, varieties of chalcedony and milky
quartz were employed, translucent and richly coloured; sometimes
even rock crystal, and also frequently a beautiful compact
haematite. Amazone stone, amethyst and fossil coral were used,
but no specimen is believed to be known of ruby, sapphire,
emerald, diamond, tourmaline or spinel.</p>

<p>The date of about 500 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> marks the beginning of a period
of great artistic taste and skill in gem carving, which extended
throughout the ancient civilized world, and lasted until the 3rd
or 4th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> Prior to this period, all the work appears
to have been done by hand with a sapphire point, or else with a
bow-drill; thenceforward the wheel came to be largely employed.
The Greek cutters, in their best period, the 5th and 6th centuries
<span class="scs">B.C.</span>, knew the use of disks and drills, but preferred the sapphire
point for their finest work, and continued to use it for two or
three hundred years. Engraving by the bow-drill was introduced
in Assyrian and Babylonian work as early as perhaps 3000 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>,
the earlier carving being all done with the sapphire point, which
was secured in a handle for convenient application. This handwork
demanded the utmost skill and delicacy of touch in the
artist. The bow-drill consisted of a similar point fastened in the
end of a stick, which could be rotated by means of a horizontal
cross-bar attached at each end to a string wound around the
stick; as the cross-bar was moved up and down, the stick was
made to rotate alternately in opposite directions. This has been
a frequent device for such purposes among many peoples, both
ancient and modern, civilized and uncivilized. The point used
by hand, and the bow-drill, were afterwards variously combined
in executing such work. Another modification was the substitution
for the point, in either process, of a hollow tube or drill,
probably in most cases the joint of a hollow reed, whereby very
accurate circles could be made, as also crescent figures and the
like. This process, used with fine hard sand, has also been
widely employed among many peoples. It may perhaps have
been suggested by the boring of other shells by carnivorous
molluscs of the <i>Murex</i> type, examples of which may be picked
up on any sea-beach. It is possible that the cylinder seals were
drilled in this way out of larger pieces by means of a hollow reed
or bamboo, the cylinder being left as the core.</p>

<p>The Egyptian scarabs were an early and very characteristic
type of seal cutting. The Greek gem cutters modified them by
adding Greek and Etruscan symbols and talismanic signs; many
of them also worked in Egypt and for Egyptians. Phoenician
work shows a mixture of Assyrian and Egyptian designs; and
Cypriote seals, principally on the agate gems, are known that
are referred to the 9th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Scarabs are sometimes found that have been sliced in two, and
the new flat faces thus produced carved with later inscriptions
and set in rings. This secondary work is of many kinds. An
Assyrian cylinder in the Metropolitan Museum, New York,
referred to 3000 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, bears such a cutting of Mediterranean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>196</span>
character, of the 2nd or 3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> In the early Christian
era, also, many Greek and Roman gems were recut with Gnostic
and other peculiar and obscure devices.</p>

<p>In the later Roman period, the 3rd and 4th centuries, a great
decline in the art is seen&mdash;so great that Castellani terms it &ldquo;the
idiotic age.&rdquo; Numbers of gems of this kind have been found
together, as though they were the product of a single manufacturer,
carved in the crudest manner, both in design and
execution. Yet remarkable results are sometimes produced in
these by a few touches of the drill, which under the glass appear
very crude but nevertheless yield strong effects. The same
thing may be seen now in many of the Japanese sketches and
lacquer designs, where a whole landscape is depicted, or rather
suggested, by a few simple but powerful strokes. It is now
thought that some of these seals may be of earlier origin than has
been supposed, and also that they may have been worn by the
poorer classes, who could not afford the more finished work.
They must have been made by the hundred thousand. The
decline of the art went on until in the Byzantine period, especially
the 6th century, it had reached a very low point. Most of the
gems of this period show drill-work of poor quality, although
hand-work is occasionally seen.</p>

<p>With the Renaissance, the art of gem carving revived, and the
engravers from that time and onward have produced results
that equal the best Greek and Roman work; copies of ancient
gem carvings made by some of the 18th-century masters are
only distinguishable from true antiques by experts of great
proficiency. It is in fact extremely difficult to judge positively
as to the age of engraved gems. The materials of which they are
made are hard and resistant to any change through time,
and there are many ingenious devices for producing the appearances
usually believed to indicate great age, such as slightly
dulled or scratched surfaces and the like. There are also the
gems with secondary carving, already alluded to, and the ancient
gems that have been partially recut by modern engravers for
the purpose of fraudulently enhancing their price. All these
elements enter into the problem and make it an almost hopeless
one for any but a person of great experience in the study of such
objects; and even he may not be able in all cases to decide.</p>

<p>Until the 14th century, almost all the gems were cut <i>en
cabochon</i>&mdash;that is, smoothly rounded, as carbuncles and opals
are still&mdash;or else in the form of beads drilled from both sides for
suspension or attachment, the two perforations often meeting
but imperfectly. These latter may be of Asiatic origin, brought
into Europe by commerce during the Crusades. Some of the
finest gems in the Austrian, Russian and German crowns are
stones of this perforated or bead type. An approach, or transition,
to the modern facetting is seen in a style of cutting often
used for rock-crystal in the 10th and 11th centuries: an oval
cabochon was polished flat, and the sides of the dome were also
trimmed flat, with a rounded back, and the upper side with a
ridge in the centre, tapering off to the girdle of the stone below.</p>

<p>The plane facetted cutting is altogether modern; and hence
the pictures which represent the breastplate of the ancient
Jewish high-priest as set with facetted stones are wholly imaginary
and probably incorrect, as we have no exact knowledge of the
forms of the gems. The Orientals polish gems in all sorts of
irregular, rounded shapes, according to the form of the piece as
found, and with the one object of preserving as much of its
original size and colour as possible. The greatest ingenuity is
used to make a speck of colour, as in a sapphire, tone up an entire
gem, by cutting it so that there is a point of high colour at the
lower side of the gem.</p>

<p>In later times a few facets are sometimes cut upon a generally
rounded stone. The <i>cabochon</i> method is still used for opaque
or translucent stones, as opal, moonstone, turquoise, carbuncle,
&amp;c.; but for transparent gems the facetted cutting is almost
always employed, on account of its fine effect in producing
brilliancy, by reflection or refraction of light from the under
side of the gem. Occasionally the ancients used natural crystals
with polished faces, or perhaps at times polished these to some
extent artificially. This use of crystals was frequent with prisms
of emerald, which were drilled and suspended as drops. Those
the French call &ldquo;primes d&rsquo;émeraudes.&rdquo; These were often
natural crystals from Zaborah, Egypt or the Tirol Mountains,
drilled through the height of the prism, and with little or no
polishing. In rare instances perfect and brilliant crystals may
now be seen mounted as gems.</p>

<p>The modern method is that of numerous facets, geometrically
disposed to bring out the beauty of light and colour to the best
advantage. This is done at the sacrifice of material, often to
the extent of half the stone or even more&mdash;the opposite of the
Oriental idea. There are various forms of such cutting, but
three are specially employed, known as the brilliant, the rose
and the table-cut. The last, generally made from cleavage pieces,
usually square or oblong, with a single facet or edge on each
side, and occasionally four or more facets on the lower side of the
stone, is used chiefly for emeralds, rubies and sapphires; the two
former for diamonds in particular. The brilliant is essentially
a low, double cone, its top truncated to form a large flat eight-sided
face called the table, and its basal apex also truncated
by a very small face known as the <i>culette</i> or <i>cullet</i>. The upper
and lower slopes are cut into a series of triangular facets, 32
above the girdle, in four rows of eight, and 24 below, in three
rows, making 56 facets in all. The rose form is used for diamonds
not thick enough to cut as brilliants; it is flat below and has
12 to 24, or sometimes 32, triangular facets above, in three rows,
meeting in a point. Stones thus cut are also known as &ldquo;roses
couronnées&rdquo;; others with fewer facets, twelve or even six,
are called &ldquo;roses d&rsquo;Anvers,&rdquo; and are a specialty, as their name
implies, at Antwerp. These, however, are only cut from very
thin or shallow stones. None of the rose-cut diamonds is equal
in beauty to the brilliants. There are several other forms,
among which are the &ldquo;briolette,&rdquo; &ldquo;marquise,&rdquo; oval and pear-shaped
stones, &amp;c., but they are of minor importance. The pear-shaped
brilliant is a facetted ball or drop, being a brilliant in
style of cutting, although the form of the gem is elongated
or drop-shaped. The &ldquo;marquise&rdquo; or &ldquo;navette&rdquo; form is an
elliptical brilliant of varying width in proportion to its length.
The &ldquo;rondelle&rdquo; form consists of flat, circular gems with smooth
sides pierced, like shallow beads, with facetted edges, and is
sometimes used between pearls, or gem beads, and in the coloured
gems, such as rubies, sapphires, emeralds, &amp;c. The mitred gems
fitted to a gauge are much used and are closely set together,
forming a continuous line of colour.</p>

<p>Modern gem cutting and engraving are done by means of
the lathe, which can be made to revolve with extreme rapidity,
carrying a point or small disk of soft iron, with diamond-dust
and oil. The disks vary in diameter from that of a pin-head
to a quarter of an inch. Better than the lathe, also, is the S. S.
White dental engine, which the present writer was the first to
suggest for this use. The flexibility and sensitiveness of this
machine enables it to respond to the touch of the artist and to
impart a personal quality to his work not possible with the
mechanical action of the lathe, and more like the hand-work
with the sapphire point. The diamond-dust and oil, thus applied,
will carve any stone softer than the diamond itself with comparative
ease.</p>

<p>We may now review some of the special forms of cutting and
working gems and ornamental stones that have been developed
in Europe since the period of the Renaissance.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Garnets (<i>q.v.</i>) have been used and worked from remote antiquity;
but in modern times the cutting of them has been carried on chiefly
in Bohemia, in the region around Merowitz and Dlaskowitch. The
stones occur in a trap rock, and are weathered out by its decomposition
and gathered from gravels and beds of streams. They are
of the rich red variety known as pyrope (<i>q.v.</i>), or Bohemian garnet;
it is generally valued as a gem-stone. Such are the so-called &ldquo;Cape
rubies,&rdquo; of South Africa, found in considerable quantity in German
East Africa, and the beautiful garnets known as the &ldquo;Arizona
rubies.&rdquo; Garnets are so abundant in Bohemia as to constitute an
important industry, employing some five hundred miners, an equal
number of cutters and as many as three thousand dealers. Extensive
garnet cutting is also done in India, especially at Jeypore, where
there are large works employing natives who have been taught by
Europeans. The Indian garnets, however, are mostly of another
variety, the almandine (<i>q.v.</i>); it is equally rich in colour, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>197</span>
inclining more to a violet cast than the pyrope, and can be obtained
in larger pieces. The ancient garnets, from Etruscan and Byzantine
remains, some of which are flat plates set in gold, or carved with
mythological designs, were probably obtained from India or perhaps
from the remarkable locality for large masses of garnet in German
East Africa. Many are cut with the portraits of Sassanian kings with
their characteristic pearl earrings. The East Indians carve small
dishes out of a single garnet.</p>

<p>The carving of elegant objects from transparent quartz, or rock
crystal, has been carried on since the 16th century, first in Italy, by
the greatest masters of the time, and afterwards in Prague, under
Rudolph II., until the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, when the industry was
wiped out. Splendid examples of this work are in the important
museums of Europe. Many of these are reproduced now in Vienna,
and fine examples are included in some American museums. Among
them are rock-crystal dishes several inches across, beautifully engraved
in intaglio and mounted in silver with gems. Other varieties
of quartz minerals, such as agate, jasper, &amp;c., and other ornamental
stones of similar hardness, are likewise wrought into all manner of
art objects. Caskets, vases, ewers, coupés and animal and other
fanciful forms, are familiar in these opaque and semi-transparent
stones, either carved out of single masses or made of separate pieces
united with gold, silver or enamel in the most artistic manner.
Cellini, and other masters in the 16th and 17th centuries, vied with
each other in such work.</p>

<p>The greatest development of agate (<i>q.v.</i>), however, has been seen
in Germany, at Waldkirch in Breisgau, and especially at Idar and
Oberstein on the Nahe, in Oldenburg. The industry began in the
14th century, at the neighbouring town of Freiburg, but was transferred
to Waldkirch, where it is still carried on, employing about 120
men and women, the number of workmen having increased nearly
threefold since the middle of the 19th century. The Idar and
Oberstein industry was founded somewhat later, but is much more
extensive. Mills run by water-power line the Nahe river for over
30 m., from above Kreuznach to below Idar, and gave employment in
1908 to some 5000 people&mdash;1625 lapidaries, 160 drillers, 100 engravers,
2900 cutters, &amp;c., besides 300 jewellers and 300 dealers. The industry
began here in consequence of the abundance of agates in the amygdaloid
rocks of the vicinity; and it is probable that many of the Cinque
Cento gems, and perhaps even some of the Roman ones, were obtained
in this region. By the middle of the 18th century the best
material was about exhausted, but the industry had become so
firmly established that it has been kept up and increased by importing
agates. In 1540 there were only three mills; in 1740, twenty-five;
in 1840, fifty; in 1870, one hundred and eighty-four. Agents
and prospectors are sent all over the world to procure agates and
other ornamental stones, and enormous quantities are brought there
and stored. The chief source of agate supply has been in Uruguay,
but much has been brought from other distant lands. It was estimated
that fifty thousand tons were stored at Salto in Uruguay at
one time.</p>

<p>The grinding is done on large, horizontal wheels like grindstones,
some 6 ft. in diameter and one-fourth as thick, run by water-wheels.
The faces of some of these grindstones are made with grooves of
different sizes so that round objects or convex surfaces can be ground
very easily and rapidly. An agate ball or marble, for instance, is
made from a piece broken to about the right size and held in one of
these semicircular grooves until one-half of it is shaped, and then
turned over and the other half ground in the same way. The
polishing is done on wooden wheels, with tripoli found in the vicinity;
any carving or ornamentation is then put on with a wheel-edge or a
drill by skilled workmen.</p>

<p>In the United States the Drake Company at Sioux Falls, South
Dakota, has done cutting and polishing in hard materials on a grand
scale. It is here, and here only, that the agatized wood from Chalcedony
Park, Arizona, has been cut and polished, large sections of
tree-trunks having been made into table-tops and columns of
wonderful beauty, with a polish like that of a mirror.</p>

<p>Much of the finest lapidary work, both on a large and a small scale,
is done in Russia. Catherine II. sought to develop the precious
stone resources of the Ural region, and sent thither two Italian
lapidaries. This led to the founding of an industry which now employs
at least a thousand people. The work is done either at the
great imperial lapidary establishment at Ekaterinburg, or in the
vicinity of the mines by lapidary masters, as they are called, each
of whom has his peculiar style. The products are sold to dealers
at the great Russian fairs at Nizhniy Novgorod, Moscow and
Ekaterinburg. The imperial works at the last-named place have
command of an immense water-power, and are on such a scale that
great masses of hard stones can be worked as marble is in other
countries. Much of the machinery is primitive, but the applications
are ingenious and the results unsurpassed anywhere. The work
done is of several classes, ranging from the largest and most massive
to the smallest and most delicate. There is (1) the cutting of facetted
gems, as topaz, aquamarine, amethyst, &amp;c., from the mines of the
Ural, and of other gem-stones also; this is largely done by means of
the cadrans, a small machine held in the hand, by which the angle
of the facets can be adjusted readily when once the stone has been
set, and which produces work of great beauty and accuracy. Then
there is (2) a vast variety of ornamental objects, large and small,
some weighing 2000 &#8468; and over, and requiring years to complete;
they are made from the opaque minerals of the Ural and Siberia&mdash;malachite,
rhodonite, lapis-lazuli, aventurine and jasper. A peculiar
type of work is (3) the production of beautiful groups of fruit, flowers
and leaves, in stones selected to match exactly the colour of each
object represented. These are chosen with great care and skill,
somewhat as in the Florentine mosaics, not to produce a flat inlaid
picture, however, but a perfect reproduction of form, size and colour.
These groups are carved and polished from hard stones, whereas the
Florentine mosaic work includes many substances that are much
softer, as glass, shell, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Enormous masses of material are brought to these works; the
supply of rhodonite, jade, jaspers of various colours, &amp;c., sometimes
amounting to hundreds of tons. One mass of Kalkansky jasper
weighed nearly 9 tons, and a mass of rhodonite above 50 tons;
the latter required a week of sledging, with ninety horses, to bring it
from the quarry, only 14 m. from the works. About seventy-five
men are employed, at twenty-five roubles a month (£2, 11s. 6d.),
and ten boys, who earn from two to ten roubles (4s. to £1). A
training school is connected with the works, where over fifty boys are
pupils; on graduating they may remain as government lapidaries
or set up on their own account.</p>

<p>There are two other great Russian imperial establishments of the
same kind. One of these, founded by Catherine II., is at Peterhof,
a short distance from the capital; it is a large building fitted up
with imperial elegance. Here are made all the designs and models
for the work done at Ekaterinburg; these are returned and strictly
preserved. In the Peterhof works are to be seen the largest and most
remarkable achievements of the lapidarian art, vases and pedestals
and columns of immense size, made from the hardest and most
elegant stones, often requiring the labour of years for their completion.
The third great establishment is at Kolyvan, in Siberia,
bearing a like relation to the minerals and gem-stones of the Altai
region that the works of Ekaterinburg do to the Ural. The three
establishments are conducted at large expense, from the private
revenue of the tsar. The Russian emperors have always taken
special interest in lapidary work, and the products of these establishments
have made that country famous throughout the world. The
immense monolithic columns of the Hermitage and of St Isaac&rsquo;s
Cathedral, of polished granite and other hard and elegant stones,
are among the triumphs of modern architectural work; and the
Alexander column at St Petersburg is a single polished shaft, 13 ft.
in diameter and 82 ft. in height, of the red Finland granite.</p>

<p>The finest lapidary work of modern France is done at Moulin la
Vacherie Saint Simon, Seine-et-Marne, where some seventy-five of
the most skilful artisans are engaged. The products are all manner
of ornamental objects of every variety of beautiful stone, all finished
with absolute perfection of detail. Columns and other ornaments of
porphyry and the like, of ancient workmanship, are brought hither
from Egypt and elsewhere, and recut into smaller objects for modern
artistic tastes. Here, too, are made spheres of transparent quartz&mdash;&ldquo;crystal
balls&rdquo;&mdash;up to 6 in. in diameter, the material for which is
obtained in Madagascar.</p>

<p>A few words may be said, by way of comparison and contrast,
about the lapidary art of Japan and China, especially in relation to
the crystal balls, now reproduced in France and elsewhere. The tools
are the simplest, and there is no machinery; but the lack of it is
made up by time and patience, and by hereditary pride, as a Japanese
artisan can often trace back his art through many generations
continuously. To make a quartz ball, a large crystal or mass is
chipped or broken into available shape, and then the piece is trimmed
into a spherical form with a small steel hammer. The polishing is
effected by grinding with emery and garnet-powder and plenty of
water, in semi-cylindrical pieces of cast iron, of sizes varying with
that of the ball to be ground, which is kept constantly turning as it
is rubbed. Small balls are fixed in the end of a bamboo tube, which
the worker continually revolves. The final brilliant polish is given
by the hand, with rouge-powder (haematite). This process is
evidently very slow, and only the cheapness of labour prevents the
cost from being too great.</p>

<p>The spheres are now made quite freely but very differently in
France, Germany and the United States. They are ground in semicircular
grooves in a large horizontal wheel of hard stone, such as is
used for grinding garnets at Oberstein and Idar, or else by gradually
revolving them on a lathe and fitting them into hollow cylinders.
Plenty of water must be used, to prevent heating and cracking.
The polishing is effected on a wooden wheel with tripoli. Work of
this kind is now done in the United States, in the production of the
spheres and carved ornaments of rock-crystal, that is equal to any
in the world. But most of the material for these supposed Japanese
balls now comes from Brazil or Madagascar, and the work is done in
Germany or France.</p>

<p>The cutting of amber is a special branch of lapidary work developed
along the Baltic coast of Germany, where amber is chiefly obtained.
The amber traffic dates back to prehistoric times; but the cutting
industry in northern Europe cannot be definitely traced further back
than the 14th century, when gilds of amber-workers were known at
Bruges and Lübeck. Fine carving was also done at Königsberg as
early as 1399. The latter city and Danzig have become the chief
seats of the amber industry, and the business has increased immensely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>198</span>
within a recent period. Articles are made there, not only for all the
civilized world, but for exportation to half-civilized and even
barbarous nations, in great variety of shapes, styles and colours.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sc">Diamond Cutting.</span>&mdash;On account of its extreme hardness,
the treatment of the diamond in preparation for use in jewelry
constitutes a separate and special branch of the lapidary&rsquo;s art.
Any valuable gem must first be trimmed, cleaved or sawed
into suitable shape and size, then cut into the desired form, and
finally polished upon the faces which have been cut. The stages
in diamond working are, therefore, (1) cleavage or division;
(2) cutting; (3) polishing; but in point of fact there are four
processes, as the setting of the stone for cutting is a somewhat
distinct branch, and the workers are classed in four groups&mdash;cleavers,
setters, cutters and polishers.</p>

<p>1. <i>Cleaving or Dividing.</i>&mdash;Diamonds are always found as
crystals, usually octahedral in form, though often irregular or
distorted. The problem involved in each case is twofold:
(1) to obtain the largest perfect stone possible, and (2) to remove
any portions containing flaws or defects. These ends are generally
met by cleaving the crystal, <i>i.e.</i> causing it to split along certain
natural planes of structural weakness, which are parallel with
the faces of the octahedron. This process requires the utmost
judgment, care and skill on the part of the operator, as any
error would cause great loss of valuable material; hence expert
cleavers command very high wages. The stone is first examined
closely, to determine the directions of the cleavage planes,
which are recognizable only by an expert. The cleaver then cuts
a narrow notch at the place selected, with another diamond
having a sharp point; a rather dull iron or steel edge is then laid
on this line, and a smart blow struck upon it. If all has been
skilfully done, the diamond divides at once in the direction
desired. De Boot in 1609 mentions knowing some one who could
part a diamond like mica or talc. In this process, each of the
diamonds is fixed in cement on the end of a stick or handle,
so that they can be held firmly while one is applied to the other.</p>

<p>When the stone is large and very valuable, the cleaving is a
most critical process. Wollaston in 1790 made many favourable
transactions by buying very poor-looking flawed stones and
cleaving off the good parts. In the case of the immense Excelsior
diamond of 971 carats, which was divided at Amsterdam in
1904, and made into ten splendid stones, the most elaborate
study extending over two months was given to the work beforehand,
and many models were made of the very irregular stone
and divided in different ways to determine those most advantageous.
This process was in 1908 applied to the most remarkable
piece of work of the kind ever undertaken&mdash;the cutting
of the gigantic Cullinan diamond of 3025¾ English carats. The
stone was taken to Amsterdam to be treated by the old-fashioned
hand method, with innumerable precautions of every kind at
every step, and the cutting was successfully accomplished after
nine months&rsquo; work (see <i>The Times</i>, Nov. 10, 1908). The two
principal stones obtained (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Diamond</a></span>), one a pendeloque or
drop brilliant, and the other a square brilliant, were given 72
and 64 facets respectively (exclusive of the table and cullet)
instead of the normal 56.</p>

<p>This process of cleavage is the old-established one, still used
to a large extent, especially at Amsterdam. But a different
method has recently been introduced, that of sawing,<a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a> which is
now generally employed in Antwerp. The stone is placed in a
small metal receptacle which is filled with melted aluminium;
thus embedded securely, with only the part to be cut exposed,
it is pressed firmly against the edge of a metallic disk or thin
wheel, 4 or 5 in. in diameter, made of copper, iron or phosphor
bronze, which is charged with diamond dust and oil, and made
to revolve with great velocity. This machine was announced as
an American invention, but the form now principally employed
at Antwerp was invented by a Belgian diamond cutter in the
United States, and is similar to slitting wheels used by gem
cutters for centuries. Two patents were taken out, however,
by different parties, with some distinctions of method. The
process is much slower than hand-cleavage, but greatly diminishes
the loss of material involved. It is claimed that not only can
flaws or defective portions be thus easily taken off, but that
any well-formed crystal of the usual octahedral shape (known
in the trade as &ldquo;six-point&rdquo;) can be divided in half very perfectly
at the &ldquo;girdle,&rdquo; making two stones, in each of which the sawed
face can be used with advantage to form the &ldquo;table&rdquo; of a brilliant.
By another method the stone is sawed at a tangent with the
octahedron, and then each half into three pieces; for this
Wood method a total saving of 5% is claimed. Occasionally
the finest material is only a small spot in a large mass of impure
material, and this is taken out by most skilful cleaving.</p>

<p>After the cleaving or sawing, however, the diamond is rarely
yet in a form for cutting the facets, and requires considerable
shaping. This rough &ldquo;blocking-out&rdquo; of the final form it is
to assume, by removing irregularities and making it symmetrical,
is called &ldquo;brutage.&rdquo; Well-shaped and flawless crystals, indeed
may not require to be cleaved, and then the brutage is the first
process. Here again, the old hand methods are beginning to give
place to mechanism. In either case two diamonds are taken,
each fixed in cement on the end of a handle or support, and are
rubbed one against the other until the irregularities are ground
away and the general shape desired is attained. The old method
was to do this by hand&mdash;an extremely tedious and laborious
process. The machine method, invented about 1885 and first
used by Field and Morse of Boston, is now used at Antwerp
exclusively. In this, one diamond is fixed at the centre of a
rotating apparatus, and the other, on an arm or handle, is placed
so as to press steadily against the other stone at the proper
angle. The rotating diamond thus becomes rounded and
smoothed; the other one is then put in its place at the centre
and their mutual action reversed.</p>

<p>At Amsterdam a hand-process is employed, which lies between
the cleavage and the brutage. This consists in cutting or trimming
away angles and irregularities all over the stone by means
of a sharp-edged or pointed diamond, both being mounted in
cement on pear-shaped handles for firm holding. This work is
largely done by women. In all these processes the dust and
fragments are caught and carefully saved.</p>

<p>2. <i>Cutting and Setting.</i>&mdash;The next process is that of cutting
the facets; but an intervening step is the fixing or &ldquo;setting&rdquo;
of the stone for that purpose. This is done by embedding it in
a fusible alloy, melting at 440° Fahr., in a little cup-shaped
depression on the end of a handle, the whole being called a
&ldquo;dop.&rdquo; Only the portion to be ground off is left exposed;
and two such mounted diamonds are then rubbed against each
other until a face is produced. This is the work of the cutter;
it is very laborious, and requires great care and skill. The
hands must be protected with leather gloves. The powder
produced is carefully saved, as in the former processes, for use
in the final polishing. When one face has been produced, the
alloy is softened by heating, and the stone re-set for grinding
another surface; and as this process is necessary for every face
cut, it must be repeated many times for each stone. An improved
dop has lately been devised in which the diamond is held by a
system of claws so that all this heating and resetting can, it is
claimed, be obviated, and the cutting completed with only two
changes.</p>

<p>3. <i>Polishing.</i>&mdash;The faces having thus been cut, the last stage
is the polishing. This is done upon horizontal iron wheels
called &ldquo;skaifs,&rdquo; made to rotate up to 2500 revolutions per
minute. The diamond-powder saved in the former operations,
and also made by crushing very inferior diamonds, here comes
into use as the only material for polishing. It is applied with
oil, and the stones are fixed in a &ldquo;dop&rdquo; in much the same way
as in the cutting process. Again, the utmost skill and watchfulness
are necessary, as the angles of the faces must be mathematically
exact, in order to yield the best effects by refraction and
reflection of light, and their sizes must be accurately regulated
to preserve the symmetry of the stone. In this process, also,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>199</span>
the old hand method is already replaced in part by an improved
device whereby the diamond is held by adjustable claws, on a base
that can be rotated, so as to apply it in any desired position.
By this means the time and trouble of repeated re-setting in
the dop are saved, as well as the liability to injury from the
heating and cooling; the services of special &ldquo;setters&rdquo; are also
made needless.</p>

<p>The rapid development of mechanical devices for the several
stages of diamond cutting has already greatly influenced the art.
A very interesting comparison was brought out in the thirteenth
report of the American Commissioner of Labour, as to the aspects
and relations of hand-work and machinery in this branch of
industry. It appeared from the data gathered that the advantage
lay with machinery as to time and with hand-work as to cost,
in the ratios respectively of 1 to 3.38 and 1.76 to 1. In other
words, about half the gain in time is lost by increased expense
in the use of machine methods. A great many devices and
applications have been developed within the last few years,
owing to the immense increase in the production of diamonds
from the South African mines, and their consequent widespread
use.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>History of Diamond Cutting.</i>&mdash;The East Indian diamonds, many of
which are doubtless very ancient, were polished in the usual Oriental
fashion by merely rounding off the angles. Among church jewels in
Europe are a few diamonds of unknown age and source, cut four-sided,
with a table above and a pyramid below. Several cut diamonds
are recorded among the treasures of Louis of Anjou in the third
quarter of the 14th century. But the first definite accounts of
diamond polishing are early in the century following, when one
Hermann became noted for such work in Paris. The modern method
of &ldquo;brilliant&rdquo; cutting, however, is generally ascribed to Louis de
Berquem, of Bruges, who in 1475 cut several celebrated diamonds
sent to him by Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy. He taught this
process to many pupils, who afterwards settled in Antwerp and
Amsterdam, which have been the chief centres of diamond cutting
ever since. Peruzzi was the artist who worked out the theory of the
well-proportioned brilliant of 58 facets. Some very fine work was
done early in London also, but most of the workmen were Jews, who,
being objectionable in England, finally betook themselves to
Amsterdam and Antwerp. Efforts have been lately made to re-establish
the art in London, where, as the great diamond mart of the
world, it should peculiarly belong.</p>

<p>The same unwise policy was even more marked in Portugal.
That nation had its colonial possessions in India, following the voyages
and discoveries of Da Gama, and thus became the chief importer of
diamonds into Europe. Early in the 18th century, also, the diamond-mines
were discovered in Brazil, which was then likewise a Portuguese
possession; thus the whole diamond product of the world came to
Portugal, and there was naturally developed in Lisbon an active
industry of cutting and polishing diamonds. But in time the Jews
were forced away, and went to Holland and Belgium, where diamond
cutting has been concentrated since the middle of the 18th century.</p>

<p>It is of interest to trace the recent endeavours to establish
diamond cutting in the United States. The pioneer in this movement
was Henry D. Morse of Boston, associated with James W.
Yerrington of New York. He opened a diamond-cutting establishment
about 1860 and carried it on for some years, training a number
of young men and women, who became the best cutters in the country.
But the chief importance of his work lay in its superior quality. So
long had it been a monopoly of the Dutch and Belgians that it was
declining into a mere mechanical trade. Morse studied the diamond
scientifically and taught his pupils how important mathematical
exactitude in cutting was to the beauty and value of the gem. He
thus attained a perfection rarely seen before, and gave a great
stimulus to the art. Shops were opened in London as well, in consequence
of Morse&rsquo;s success; and many valuable diamonds were
recut in the United States after his work became known. This fact
in turn reacted upon the cutter abroad, especially in France and
Switzerland; and thus the general standard of the art was greatly
advanced.</p>

<p>Diamond cutting in the United States is now a well-established
industry. From 1882 to 1885 a number of American jewelers undertook
such work, but for various reasons it was not found practicable
then. Ten years later, however, there were fifteen firms engaged in
diamond cutting, giving employment to nearly 150 men in the various
processes involved. In the year 1894 a number of European diamond
workers came over; some foreign capital became engaged; and a
rapid development of diamond cutting took place. This movement
was caused by the low tariff on uncut diamonds as compared with
that on cut stones. It went so far as to be felt seriously abroad; but
in a year or two it declined, owing partly to strikes and partly to
legal questions as to the application of some of the tariff provisions.
At the close of 1895, however, there were still some fourteen establishments
in and near New York, employing about 500 men. Since then
the industry has gradually developed. Many of the European
diamond workers who came over to America remained and carried on
their art; and the movement then begun has become permanent.
New York is now recognized as one of the chief diamond-cutting
centres; there are some 500 cutters, and the quality of work done is
fully equal, if not superior, to any in the Old World. So well is this
fact established that American-cut diamonds are exported and sold
in Europe to a considerable and an increasing extent.</p>

<p>In the Brazilian diamond region of Minas Geraes an industry of
cutting has grown up since 1875. Small mills are run by water power,
and the machinery, as well as the methods, are from Holland. This
Brazilian diamond work is done both well and cheaply, and supplies
the local market.</p>

<p>The leading position in diamond working still belongs to Amsterdam,
where the number of persons engaged in the industry has
trebled since about 1875, in consequence of the enormous increase
in the world&rsquo;s supply of diamonds. The number now amounts to
15,000, about one-third of whom are actual cleavers, cutters, polishers,
&amp;c. The number of cutting establishments in Amsterdam is about
seventy, containing some 7000 mills.</p>

<p>Antwerp comes next with about half as many mills and a total of
some 4500 persons engaged in all departments, including about
seventy women. These are distributed among thirty-five or forty
establishments. A majority of the workers are Belgians, but there
are many Dutch, Poles and Austro-Hungarians, principally Jews.
Among these numerous employees there is much opportunity for
dishonesty, and but little surveillance, actual or possible; yet losses
from this cause are almost unknown. The wages paid are good,
averaging from £2, 9s. 6d. to £2, 17s. 6d. a week. Sorters receive
from 28s. to £2; cutters from £2, 9s. 6d to £3, 6s., and cleavers from
£3, 14s. upwards.</p>

<p>With the recent introduction of electricity in diamond cutting
there has been a revolution in that industry. Whereas formerly
wheels were made to revolve by steam, they are now placed in direct
connexion with electric motors, although there is not a motor to each
machine. The saws for slitting the diamond can thus be made to
revolve much more rapidly, and there is a cleanliness and a speed
about the work never before attained.</p>

a stone), a name applied to small fragments of lava ejected from
a volcano. They are generally subangular in shape and vesicular
in structure, varying in size from a pea to a walnut. In the
Neapolitan dialect the word becomes <i>rapilli</i>&mdash;a form sometimes
used by English writers on volcanoes. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Volcanoes</a></span>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAPIS LAZULI<a name="ar142" id="ar142"></a></span>, or azure stone,<a name="fa1h" id="fa1h" href="#ft1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a> a mineral substance valued
for decorative purposes in consequence of the fine blue colour
which it usually presents. It appears to have been the sapphire
of ancient writers: thus Theophrastus describes the <span class="grk" title="sappheiros">&#963;&#940;&#960;&#966;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>
as being spotted with gold-dust, a description quite inappropriate
to modern sapphire, but fully applicable to lapis lazuli, for this
stone frequently contains disseminated particles of iron-pyrites of
gold-like appearance. Pliny, too, refers to the <i>sapphirus</i> as
a stone sprinkled with specks of gold; and possibly an allusion
to the same character may be found in Job xxviii. 6. The
Hebrew <i>sappir</i>, denoting a stone in the High Priest&rsquo;s breastplate,
was probably lapis lazuli, as acknowledged in the Revised
Version of the Bible. With the ancient Egyptians lapis lazuli
was a favourite stone for amulets and ornaments such as scarabs;
it was also used to a limited extent by the Assyrians and Babylonians
for cylinder seals. It has been suggested that the
Egyptians obtained it from Persia in exchange for their emeralds.
When the lapis lazuli contains pyrites, the brilliant spots in the
deep blue matrix invite comparison with the stars in the firmament.
The stone seems to have been sometimes called by ancient
writers <span class="grk" title="kyanos">&#954;&#973;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>. It was a favourite material with the Italians
of the <i>Cinquecento</i> for vases, small busts and other ornaments.
Magnificent examples of the decorative use of lapis lazuli are to
be seen in St Petersburg, notably in the columns of St Isaac&rsquo;s
cathedral. The beautiful blue colour of lapis lazuli led to its
employment, when ground and levigated, as a valuable pigment
known as ultramarine (<i>q.v.</i>), a substance now practically displaced
by a chemical product (artificial ultramarine).</p>

<p>Lapis lazuli occurs usually in compact masses, with a finely
granular structure; and occasionally, but only as a great rarity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>200</span>
it presents the form of the rhombic dodecahedron. Its specific
gravity is 2.38 to 2.45, and its hardness about 5.5, so that being
comparatively soft it tends, when polished, to lose its lustre
rather readily. The colour is generally a fine azure or rich
Berlin blue, but some varieties exhibit green, violet and even red
tints, or may be altogether colourless. The colour is sometimes
improved by heating the stone. Under artificial illumination
the dark-blue stones may appear almost black. The mineral
is opaque, with only slight translucency at thin edges.</p>

<p>Analyses of lapis lazuli show considerable variation in composition,
and this led long ago to doubt as to its homogeneity.
This doubt was confirmed by the microscopic studies of L. H.
Fischer, F. Zirkel and H. P. J. Vogelsang, who found that sections
showed bluish particles in a white matrix; but it was reserved
for Professor W. C. Brögger and H. Bäckström, of Christiania,
to separate the several constituents and subject them to analysis,
thus demonstrating the true constitution of lapis lazuli, and
proving that it is a rock rather than a definite mineral species.
The essential part of most lapis lazuli is a blue mineral allied to
sodalite and crystallized in the cubic system, which Brögger
distinguishes as lazurite, but this is intimately associated with
a closely related mineral which has long been known as haüyne,
or haüynite. The lazurite, sometimes regarded as true lapis
lazuli, is a sulphur-bearing sodium and aluminium silicate,
having the formula: Na<span class="su">4</span>(NaS<span class="su">3</span>Al) Al<span class="su">2</span>(SiO<span class="su">4</span>)<span class="su">3</span>. As the lazurite
and the haüynite seem to occur in molecular intermixture,
various kinds of lapis lazuli are formed; and it has been proposed
to distinguish some of them as lazurite-lapis and haüyne-lapis,
according as one or the other mineral prevails. The lazurite
of lapis lazuli is to be carefully distinguished from lazulite, an
aluminium-magnesium phosphate, related to turquoise. In
addition to the blue cubic minerals in lapis lazuli, the following
minerals have also been found: a non-ferriferous diopside,
an amphibole called, from the Russian mineralogist, koksharovite,
orthoclase, plagioclase, a muscovite-like mica, apatite, titanite,
zircon, calcite and pyrite. The calcite seems to form in some
cases a great part of the lapis; and the pyrite, which may occur
in patches, is often altered to limonite.</p>

<p>Lapis lazuli usually occurs in crystalline limestone, and seems
to be a product of contact metamorphism. It is recorded from
Persia, Tartary, Tibet and China, but many of the localities
are vague and some doubtful. The best known and probably
the most important locality is in Badakshan. There it occurs
in limestone, in the valley of the river Kokcha, a tributary to
the Oxus, south of Firgamu. The mines were visited by Marco
Polo in 1271, by J. B. Fraser in 1825, and by Captain John Wood
in 1837-1838. The rock is split by aid of fire. Three varieties
of the lapis lazuli are recognized by the miners: <i>nili</i> of indigo-blue
colour, <i>asmani</i> sky-blue, and <i>sabzi</i> of green tint. Another
locality for lapis lazuli is in Siberia near the western extremity
of Lake Baikal, where it occurs in limestone at its contact with
granite. Fine masses of lapis lazuli occur in the Andes, in
the vicinity of Ovalle, Chile. In Europe lapis lazuli is found
as a rarity in the peperino of Latium, near Rome, and in the
ejected blocks of Monte Somma, Vesuvius.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAPITHAE,<a name="ar143" id="ar143"></a></span> a mythical race, whose home was in Thessaly
in the valley of the Peneus. The genealogies make them a
kindred race with the Centaurs, their king Peirithoüs being the
son, and the Centaurs the grandchildren (or sons) of Ixion.
The best-known legends with which they are connected are those
of Ixion (<i>q.v.</i>) and the battle with the Centaurs (<i>q.v.</i>). A well-known
Lapith was Caeneus, said to have been originally a girl
named Caenis, the favourite of Poseidon, who changed her into
a man and made her invulnerable (Ovid, <i>Metam.</i> xii. 146 ff).
In the Centaur battle, having been crushed by rocks and trunks
of trees, he was changed into a bird; or he disappeared into the
depths of the earth unharmed. According to some, the Lapithae
are representatives of the giants of fable, or spirits of the storm;
according to others, they are a semi-legendary; semi-historical
race, like the Myrmidons and other Thessalian tribes. The
Greek sculptors of the school of Pheidias conceived of the battle
of the Lapithae and Centaurs as a struggle between mankind
and mischievous monsters, and symbolical of the great conflict
between the Greeks and Persians. Sidney Colvin (<i>Journ.
Hellen. Stud.</i> i. 64) explains it as a contest of the physical
powers of nature, and the mythical expression of the terrible
effects of swollen waters.</p>

In 1640 he published a work, <i>Theses theologicae de statu hominis

as containing liberal ideas about the doctrine of original sin.
The view that the original sin of Adam was not imputed to his
descendants was condemned at the synod of Charenton (1645),
without special reference being made to La Place, whose position
perhaps was not quite clear. As a matter of fact La Place
distinguished between a direct and indirect imputation, and

school of Beaumont, the classes of which he had attended as an
extern. He was not more than eighteen when, armed with
letters of recommendation, he approached J. B. d&rsquo;Alembert, then
at the height of his fame, in the hope of finding a career in Paris.
The letters remained unnoticed, but Laplace was not crushed by
the rebuff. He wrote to the great geometer a letter on the
principles of mechanics, which evoked an immediate and enthusiastic
response. &ldquo;You,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Alembert to him, &ldquo;needed no
introduction; you have recommended yourself; my support
is your due.&rdquo; He accordingly obtained for him an appointment
as professor of mathematics in the École Militaire of Paris, and
continued zealously to forward his interests.</p>

<p>Laplace had not yet completed his twenty-fourth year when
he entered upon the course of discovery which earned him the
title of &ldquo;the Newton of France.&rdquo; Having in his first published
paper<a name="fa1i" id="fa1i" href="#ft1i"><span class="sp">1</span></a> shown his mastery of analysis, he proceeded to apply its
resources to the great outstanding problems in celestial mechanics.
Of these the most conspicuous was offered by the opposite
inequalities of Jupiter and Saturn, which the emulous efforts
of L. Euler and J. L. Lagrange had failed to bring within the
bounds of theory. The discordance of their results incited
Laplace to a searching examination of the whole subject of
planetary perturbations, and his maiden effort was rewarded
with a discovery which constituted, when developed and completely
demonstrated by his own further labours and those of
his illustrious rival Lagrange, the most important advance
made in physical astronomy since the time of Newton. In a paper
read before the Academy of Sciences, on the 10th of February
1773 (<i>Mém. présentés par divers savans</i>, tom, vii., 1776), Laplace
announced his celebrated conclusion of the invariability of
planetary mean motions, carrying the proof as far as the cubes
of the eccentricities and inclinations. This was the first and
most important step in the establishment of the stability of the
solar system. It was followed by a series of profound investigations,
in which Lagrange and Laplace alternately surpassed and
supplemented each other in assigning limits of variation to the
several elements of the planetary orbits. The analytical tournament
closed with the communication to the Academy by Laplace,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>201</span>
in 1787, of an entire group of remarkable discoveries. It would
be difficult, in the whole range of scientific literature, to point
to a memoir of equal brilliancy with that published (divided into
three parts) in the volumes of the Academy for 1784, 1785 and
1786. The long-sought cause of the &ldquo;great inequality&rdquo; of
Jupiter and Saturn was found in the near approach to commensurability
of their mean motions; it was demonstrated in
two elegant theorems, independently of any except the most
general considerations as to mass, that the mutual action of the
planets could never largely affect the eccentricities and inclinations
of their orbits; and the singular peculiarities detected by
him in the Jovian system were expressed in the so-called &ldquo;laws
of Laplace.&rdquo; He completed the theory of these bodies in a
treatise published among the Paris <i>Memoirs</i> for 1788 and 1789;
and the striking superiority of the tables computed by J. B. J.
Delambre from the data there supplied marked the profit derived
from the investigation by practical astronomy. The year 1787
was rendered further memorable by Laplace&rsquo;s announcement on
the 19th of November (<i>Memoirs</i>, 1786), of the dependence of
lunar acceleration upon the secular changes in the eccentricity
of the earth&rsquo;s orbit. The last apparent anomaly, and the last
threat of instability, thus disappeared from the solar system.</p>

<p>With these brilliant performances the first period of Laplace&rsquo;s
scientific career may be said to have closed. If he ceased to
make striking discoveries in celestial mechanics, it was rather
their subject-matter than his powers that failed. The general
working of the great machine was now laid bare, and it needed a
further advance of knowledge to bring a fresh set of problems
within reach of investigation. The time had come when the
results obtained in the development and application of the law
of gravitation by three generations of illustrious mathematicians
might be presented from a single point of view. To this task
the second period of Laplace&rsquo;s activity was devoted. As a
monument of mathematical genius applied to the celestial
revolutions, the <i>Mécanique céleste</i> ranks second only to the
<i>Principia</i> of Newton.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The declared aim of the author<a name="fa2i" id="fa2i" href="#ft2i"><span class="sp">2</span></a> was to offer a complete solution
of the great mechanical problem presented by the solar system, and
to bring theory to coincide so closely with observation that empirical
equations should no longer find a place in astronomical tables. His
success in both respects fell little short of his lofty ideal. The
first part of the work (2 vols. 4to, Paris, 1799) contains methods
for calculating the movements of translation and rotation of the
heavenly bodies, for determining their figures, and resolving tidal
problems; the second, especially dedicated to the improvement of
tables, exhibits in the third and fourth volumes (1802 and 1805) the
application of these formulae; while a fifth volume, published in
three instalments, 1823-1825, comprises the results of Laplace&rsquo;s
latest researches, together with a valuable history of progress in
each separate branch of his subject. In the delicate task of apportioning
his own large share of merit, he certainly does not err on
the side of modesty; but it would perhaps be as difficult to produce
an instance of injustice, as of generosity in his estimate of others.
Far more serious blame attaches to his all but total suppression in
the body of the work&mdash;and the fault pervades the whole of his
writings&mdash;of the names of his predecessors and contemporaries.
Theorems and formulae are appropriated wholesale without acknowledgment,
and a production which may be described as the organized
result of a century of patient toil presents itself to the world as the
offspring of a single brain. The <i>Mécanique céleste</i> is, even to those
most conversant with analytical methods, by no means easy reading.
J. B. Biot, who assisted in the correction of its proof sheets, remarked
that it would have extended, had the demonstrations been
fully developed, to eight or ten instead of five volumes; and he saw
at times the author himself obliged to devote an hour&rsquo;s labour to
recovering the dropped links in the chain of reasoning covered by the
recurring formula. &ldquo;Il est aisé à voir.&rdquo;<a name="fa3i" id="fa3i" href="#ft3i"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Exposition du système du monde</i> (Paris, 1796) has been
styled by Arago &ldquo;the <i>Mécanique céleste</i> disembarrassed of its
analytical paraphernalia.&rdquo; Conclusions are not merely stated
in it, but the methods pursued for their attainment are indicated.
It has the strength of an analytical treatise, the charm of a
popular dissertation. The style is lucid and masterly, and the
summary of astronomical history with which it terminates has
been reckoned one of the masterpieces of the language. To this
linguistic excellence the writer owed the place accorded to him
in 1816 in the Academy, of which institution he became president
in the following year. The famous &ldquo;nebular hypothesis&rdquo; of
Laplace made its appearance in the <i>Système du monde</i>. Although
relegated to a note (vii.), and propounded &ldquo;Avec la défiance que
doit inspirer tout ce qui n&rsquo;est point un résultat de l&rsquo;observation
ou du calcul,&rdquo; it is plain, from the complacency with which he
recurred to it<a name="fa4i" id="fa4i" href="#ft4i"><span class="sp">4</span></a> at a later date, that he regarded the speculation
with considerable interest. That it formed the starting-point,
and largely prescribed the course of thought on the subject of
planetary origin is due to the simplicity of its assumptions, and
the clearness of the mechanical principles involved, rather than
to any cogent evidence of its truth. It is curious that Laplace,
while bestowing more attention than they deserved on the crude
conjectures of Buffon, seems to have been unaware that he had
been, to some extent, anticipated by Kant, who had put forward
in 1755, in his <i>Allgemeine Naturgeschichte</i>, a true though defective
nebular cosmogony.</p>

<p>The career of Laplace was one of scarcely interrupted
prosperity. Admitted to the Academy of Sciences as an associate
in 1773, he became a member in 1785, having, about a year
previously, succeeded E. Bezout as examiner to the royal
artillery. During an access of revolutionary suspicion, he was
removed from the commission of weights and measures; but
the slight was quickly effaced by new honours. He was one of
the first members, and became president of the Bureau of
Longitudes, took a prominent place at the Institute (founded in
1796), professed analysis at the École Normale, and aided in the
organization of the decimal system. The publication of the
<i>Mécanique céleste</i> gained him world-wide celebrity, and his name
appeared on the lists of the principal scientific associations of
Europe, including the Royal Society. But scientific distinctions
by no means satisfied his ambition. He aspired to the rôle of
a politician, and has left a memorable example of genius degraded
to servility for the sake of a riband and a title. The ardour of his
republican principles gave place, after the 18th Brumaire, to
devotion towards the first consul, a sentiment promptly rewarded
with the post of minister of the interior. His incapacity for affairs
was, however, so flagrant that it became necessary to supersede
him at the end of six weeks, when Lucien Bonaparte became his
successor. &ldquo;He brought into the administration,&rdquo; said Napoleon,
&ldquo;the spirit of the infinitesimals.&rdquo; His failure was consoled by
elevation to the senate, of which body he became chancellor
in September 1803. He was at the same time named grand
officer of the Legion of Honour, and obtained in 1813 the same
rank in the new order of Reunion. The title of count he had
acquired on the creation of the empire. Nevertheless he cheerfully
gave his voice in 1814 for the dethronement of his patron,
and his &ldquo;suppleness&rdquo; merited a seat in the chamber of peers,
and, in 1817, the dignity of a marquisate. The memory of these
tergiversations is perpetuated in his writings. The first edition
of the <i>Système du monde</i> was inscribed to the Council of Five
Hundred; to the third volume of the <i>Mécanique céleste</i> (1802)
was prefixed the declaration that, of all the truths contained in
the work, that most precious to the author was the expression
of his gratitude and devotion towards the &ldquo;pacificator of
Europe&rdquo;; upon which noteworthy protestation the suppression
in the editions of the <i>Théorie des probabilités</i> subsequent to the
restoration, of the original dedication to the emperor formed a
fitting commentary.</p>

<p>During the later years of his life, Laplace lived much at
Arcueil, where he had a country-place adjoining that of his
friend C. L. Berthollet. With his co-operation the Société
d&rsquo;Arcueil was formed, and he occasionally contributed to its
<i>Memoirs</i>. In this peaceful retirement he pursued his studies
with unabated ardour, and received with uniform courtesy
distinguished visitors from all parts of the world. Here, too,
he died, attended by his physician, Dr Majendie, and his mathematical
coadjutor, Alexis Bouvard, on the 5th of March 1827.
His last words were: &ldquo;Ce que nous connaissons est peu de
chose, ce que nous ignorons est immense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Expressions occur in Laplace&rsquo;s private letters inconsistent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>202</span>
with the atheistical opinions he is commonly believed to have
held. His character, notwithstanding the egotism by which it
was disfigured, had an amiable and engaging side. Young
men of science found in him an active benefactor. His relations
with these &ldquo;adopted children of his thought&rdquo; possessed a singular
charm of affectionate simplicity; their intellectual progress
and material interests were objects of equal solicitude to him,
and he demanded in return only diligence in the pursuit of
knowledge. Biot relates that, when he himself was beginning
his career, Laplace introduced him at the Institute for the
purpose of explaining his supposed discovery of equations of
mixed differences, and afterwards showed him, under a strict
pledge of secrecy, the papers, then yellow with age, in which he
had long before obtained the same results. This instance of
abnegation is the more worthy of record that it formed a marked
exception to Laplace&rsquo;s usual course. Between him and A. M.
Legendre there was a feeling of &ldquo;more than coldness,&rdquo; owing
to his appropriation, with scant acknowledgment, of the fruits
of the other&rsquo;s labours; and Dr Thomas Young counted himself,
rightly or wrongly, amongst the number of those similarly
aggrieved by him. With Lagrange, on the other hand, he
always remained on the best of terms. Laplace left a son, Charles
Emile Pierre Joseph Laplace (1789-1874), who succeeded to his
title, and rose to the rank of general in the artillery.</p>

<p>It might be said that Laplace was a great mathematician by
the original structure of his mind, and became a great discoverer
through the sentiment which animated it. The regulated
enthusiasm with which he regarded the system of nature was
with him from first to last. It can be traced in his earliest essay,
and it dictated the ravings of his final illness. By it his extraordinary
analytical powers became strictly subordinated to
physical investigations. To this lofty quality of intellect he
added a rare sagacity in perceiving analogies, and in detecting
the new truths that lay concealed in his formulae, and a tenacity
of mental grip, by which problems, once seized, were held fast,
year after year, until they yielded up their solutions. In every
branch of physical astronomy, accordingly, deep traces of his
work are visible. &ldquo;He would have completed the science of the
skies,&rdquo; Baron Fourier remarked, &ldquo;had the science been capable
of completion.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It may be added that he first examined the conditions of stability
of the system formed by Saturn&rsquo;s rings, pointed out the necessity for
their rotation, and fixed for it a period (10<span class="sp">h</span> 33<span class="sp">m</span>) virtually identical
with that established by the observations of Herschel; that he
detected the existence in the solar system of an invariable plane such
that the sum of the products of the planetary masses by the projections
upon it of the areas described by their radii vectores in a given
time is a maximum; and made notable advances in the theory of
astronomical refraction (<i>Méc. cél.</i> tom. iv. p. 258), besides constructing
satisfactory formulae for the barometrical determination of
heights (<i>Méc. cél.</i> tom. iv. p. 324). His removal of the considerable
discrepancy between the actual and Newtonian velocities of sound,<a name="fa5i" id="fa5i" href="#ft5i"><span class="sp">5</span></a>
by taking into account the increase of elasticity due to the heat of
compression, would alone have sufficed to illustrate a lesser name.
Molecular physics also attracted his notice, and he announced in
1824 his purpose of treating the subject in a separate work. With
A. Lavoisier he made an important series of experiments on specific
heat (1782-1784), in the course of which the &ldquo;ice calorimeter&rdquo; was
invented; and they contributed jointly to the <i>Memoirs</i> of the
Academy (1781) a paper on the development of electricity by evaporation.
Laplace was, moreover, the first to offer a complete analysis
of capillary action based upon a definite hypothesis&mdash;that of forces
&ldquo;sensible only at insensible distances&rdquo;; and he made strenuous but
unsuccessful efforts to explain the phenomena of light on an identical
principle. It was a favourite idea of his that chemical affinity and
capillary attraction would eventually be included under the same
law, and it was perhaps because of its recalcitrance to this cherished
generalization that the undulatory theory of light was distasteful to
him.</p>

<p>The investigation of the figure of equilibrium of a rotating fluid
mass engaged the persistent attention of Laplace. His first memoir
was communicated to the Academy in 1773, when he was only twenty-four,
his last in 1817, when he was sixty-eight. The results of his
many papers on this subject&mdash;characterized by him as &ldquo;un des points
les plus intéressans du système du monde&rdquo;&mdash;are embodied in the
<i>Mécanique céleste</i>, and furnish one of the most remarkable proofs
of his analytical genius. C. Maclaurin, Legendre and d&rsquo;Alembert
had furnished partial solutions of the problem, confining their
attention to the possible figures which would satisfy the conditions of
equilibrium. Laplace treated the subject from the point of view of
the gradual aggregation and cooling of a mass of matter, and demonstrated
that the form which such a mass would ultimately assume
must be an ellipsoid of revolution whose equator was determined by
the primitive plane of maximum areas.</p>

<p>The related subject of the attraction of spheroids was also signally
promoted by him. Legendre, in 1783, extended Maclaurin&rsquo;s theorem
concerning ellipsoids of revolution to the case of any spheroid of
revolution where the attracted point, instead of being limited to the
axis or equator, occupied any position in space; and Laplace, in his
treatise <i>Théorie du mouvement et de la figure elliptique des planètes</i>
(published in 1784), effected a still further generalization by proving,
what had been suspected by Legendre, that the theorem was equally
true for any confocal ellipsoids. Finally, in a celebrated memoir,
<i>Théorie des attractions des sphéroides et de la figure des planètes</i>,
published in 1785 among the Paris <i>Memoirs</i> for the year 1782,
although written after the treatise of 1784, Laplace treated exhaustively
the general problem of the attraction of any spheroid upon
a particle situated outside or upon its surface.</p>

<p>These researches derive additional importance from having introduced
two powerful engines of analysis for the treatment of physical
problems, Laplace&rsquo;s coefficients and the potential function. By his
discovery that the attracting force in any direction of a mass upon a
particle could be obtained by the direct process of differentiating a
single function, Laplace laid the foundations of the mathematical
sciences of heat, electricity and magnetism. The expressions
designated by Dr Whewell, Laplace&rsquo;s coefficients (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Spherical
Harmonics</a></span>) were definitely introduced in the memoir of 1785 on
attractions above referred to. In the figure of the earth, the theory
of attractions, and the sciences of electricity and magnetism this
powerful calculus occupies a prominent place. C. F. Gauss in particular
employed it in the calculation of the magnetic potential of the
earth, and it received new light from Clerk Maxwell&rsquo;s interpretation
of harmonics with reference to poles on the sphere.</p>

<p>Laplace nowhere displayed the massiveness of his genius more
conspicuously than in the theory of probabilities. The science which
B. Pascal and P. de Fermat had initiated he brought very nearly
to perfection; but the demonstrations are so involved, and the
omissions in the chain of reasoning so frequent, that the <i>Théorie
analytique</i> (1812) is to the best mathematicians a work requiring
most arduous study. The theory of probabilities, which Laplace
described as common sense expressed in mathematical language,
engaged his attention from its importance in physics and astronomy;
and he applied his theory, not only to the ordinary problems of
chances, but also to the inquiry into the causes of phenomena, vital
statistics and future events.</p>

<p>The device known as the method of least squares, for reducing
numerous equations of condition to the number of unknown quantities
to be determined, had been adopted as a practically convenient rule
by Gauss and Legendre; but Laplace first treated it as a problem
in probabilities, and proved by an intricate and difficult course of
reasoning that it was also the most advantageous, the mean of the
probabilities of error in the determination of the elements being
thereby reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p>Laplace published in 1779 the method of generating functions, the
foundation of his theory of probabilities, and the first part of his
<i>Théorie analytique</i> is devoted to the exposition of its principles,
which in their simplest form consist in treating the successive values
of any function as the coefficients in the expansion of another
function with reference to a different variable. The latter is therefore
called the generating function of the former. A <i>direct</i> and an
<i>inverse</i> calculus is thus created, the object of the former being to
determine the coefficients from the generating function, of the
latter to discover the generating function from the coefficients.
The one is a problem of interpolation, the other a step towards the
solution of an equation in finite differences. The method, however,
is now obsolete owing to the more extended facilities afforded by
the calculus of operations.</p>

<p>The first formal proof of Lagrange&rsquo;s theorem for the development
in a series of an implicit function was furnished by Laplace, who
gave to it an extended generality. He also showed that every
equation of an even degree must have at least one real quadratic
factor, reduced the solution of linear differential equations to
definite integrals, and furnished an elegant method by which the
linear partial differential equation of the second order might be
solved. He was also the first to consider the difficult problems
involved in equations of mixed differences, and to prove that an
equation in finite differences of the first degree and the second order
might always be converted into a continued fraction.</p>

<p>In 1842, the works of Laplace being nearly out of print, his widow
was about to sell a farm to procure funds for a new impression, when
the government of Louis Philippe took the matter in hand. A grant
of 40,000 francs having been obtained from the chamber, a national
edition was issued in seven 4to vols., bearing the title <i>&OElig;uvres de
Laplace</i> (1843-1847). The <i>Mécanique céleste</i> with its four supplements
occupies the first 5 vols., the 6th contains the <i>Système du
monde</i>, and the 7th the <i>Th. des probabilités</i>, to which the more popular
<i>Essai philosophique</i> forms an introduction. Of the four supplements
added by the author (1816-1825) he tells us that the problems in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>203</span>
last were contributed by his son. An enumeration of Laplace&rsquo;s
memoirs and papers (about one hundred in number) is rendered
superfluous by their embodiment in his principal works. The <i>Th.
des prob.</i> was first published in 1812, the <i>Essai</i> in 1814; and both
works as well as the <i>Système du monde</i> went through repeated
editions. An English version of the <i>Essai</i> appeared in New York in
1902. Laplace&rsquo;s first separate work, <i>Théorie du mouvement et de la
figure elliptique des planètes</i> (1784), was published at the expense
of President Bochard de Saron. The <i>Précis de l&rsquo;histoire de l&rsquo;astronomie</i>
(1821), formed the fifth book of the 5th edition of the <i>Système
du monde</i>. An English translation, with copious elucidatory notes,
of the first 4 vols. of the <i>Mécanique céleste</i>, by N. Bowditch, was
published at Boston, U.S. (1829-1839), in 4 vols. 4to.; a compendium
of certain portions of the same work by Mrs Somerville appeared in
1831, and a German version of the first 2 vols. by Burckhardt at
Berlin in 1801. English translations of the <i>Système du monde</i> by
J. Pond and H. H. Harte were published, the first in 1809, the
second in 1830. An edition entitled <i>Les &OElig;uvres complètes de Laplace</i>
(1878), &amp;c., which is to include all his memoirs as well as his separate
works, is in course of publication under the auspices of the Academy
of Sciences. The thirteenth 4to volume was issued in 1904. Some
of Laplace&rsquo;s results in the theory of probabilities are simplified in
S. F. Lacroix&rsquo;s <i>Traité élémentaire du calcul des probabilités</i> and De
Morgan&rsquo;s <i>Essay</i>, published in Lardner&rsquo;s <i>Cabinet Cyclopaedia</i>. For
the history of the subject see <i>A History of the Mathematical Theory of
Probability</i>, by Isaac Todhunter (1865). Laplace&rsquo;s treatise on
specific heat was published in German in 1892 as No. 40 of W.
Ostwald&rsquo;s <i>Klassiker der exacten Wissenschaften</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAPLAND<a name="ar146" id="ar146"></a></span>, or <span class="sc">Lappland</span>, a name used to indicate the region
of northern Europe inhabited by the Lapps, though not applied
to any administrative district. It covers in Norway the division
(amter) of Finmarken and the higher inland parts of Tromsö and
Nordland; in Russian territory the western part of the government
of Archangel as far as the White Sea and the northern
part of the Finnish district of Uleåborg; and in Sweden the
inland and northern parts of the old province of Norrland,
roughly coincident with the districts (<i>län</i>) of Norbotten and
Vesterbotten, and divided into five divisions&mdash;Torne Lappmark,
Lule Lappmark, Pite Lappmark, Lycksele Lappmark and
Åsele Lappmark. The Norwegian portion is thus insignificant;
of the Russian only a little lies south of the Arctic circle, and the
whole is less accessible and more sparsely populated than the
Swedish, the southern boundary of which may be taken arbitrarily
at about 64° N., though scattered families of Lapps occur
much farther south, even in the Hardanger Fjeld in Norway.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian portion of Lapland presents the usual
characteristics of the mountain plateau of that peninsula&mdash;on the
west side the bold headlands and fjords, deeply-grooved valleys
and glaciers of Norway, on the east the long mountain lakes and
great lake-fed rivers of Sweden. Russian Lapland is broadly
similar to the lower-lying parts of Swedish Lapland, but the
great lakes are more generally distributed, and the valleys are
less direct. The country is low and gently undulating, broken
by detached hills and ridges not exceeding in elevation 2500 ft.
In the uplands of Swedish Lapland, and to some extent in
Russian Lapland, the lakes afford the principal means of communication;
it is almost impossible to cross the forests from
valley to valley without a native guide. In Sweden the few farms
of the Swedes who inhabit the region are on the lake shores,
and the traveller must be rowed from one to another in the
typical boats of the district, pointed at bow and stern, unusually
low amidships, and propelled by short sculls or paddles. Sailing
is hardly ever practised, and squalls on the lakes are often
dangerous to the rowing-boats. On a few of the lakes wood-fired
steam-launches are used in connexion with the timber trade,
which is considerable, as practically the whole region is forested.
Between the lakes all journeying is made on foot. The heads
of the Swedish valleys are connected with the Norwegian fjords
by passes generally traversed only by tracks; though from
the head of the Ume a driving road crosses to Mo on Ranen
Fjord. Each principal valley has a considerable village at
or near the tail of the lake-chain, up to which a road runs along
the valley. The village consists of wooden cottages with an inn
(<i>gästgifvaregård</i>), a church, and frequently a collection of huts
without windows, closed in summer, but inhabited by the Lapps
when they come down from the mountains to the winter fairs.
Sometimes there is another church and small settlement in the
upper valley, to which, once or twice in a summer, the Lapps
come from great distances to attend service. To these, too, they
sometimes bring their dead for burial, bearing them if necessary
on a journey of many days. Though Lapland gives little scope
for husbandry, a bad summer being commonly followed by a
winter famine, it is richly furnished with much that is serviceable
to man. There are copper-mines at the mountain of Sulitelma,
and the iron deposits in Norrland are among the most extensive
in the world. Their working is facilitated by the railway from
Stockholm to Gellivara, Kirunavara and Narvik on the Norwegian
coast, which also connects them with the port of Luleå
on the Gulf of Bothnia. The supply of timber (pine, fir, spruce
and birch) is unlimited. Though fruit-trees will not bear there
is an abundance of edible berries; the rivers and lakes abound
with trout, perch, pike and other fish, and in the lower waters
with salmon; and the cod, herring, halibut and Greenland
shark in the northern seas attract numerous Norwegian and
Russian fishermen.</p>

<p>The climate is thoroughly Arctic. In the northern parts
unbroken daylight in summer and darkness in winter last from
two to three months each; and through the greater part of the
country the sun does not rise at mid-winter or set at midsummer.
In December and January in the far north there is little more
daylight than a cold glimmer of dawn; by February, however,
there are some hours of daylight; in March the heat of the sun
is beginning to modify the cold, and now and in April the birds of
passage begin to appear. In April the snow is melting from the
branches; spring comes in May; spring flowers are in blossom,
and grain is sown. At the end of this month or in June the ice
is breaking up on the lakes, woods rush into leaf, and the unbroken
daylight of the northern summer soon sets in. July is quite
warm; the great rivers come down full from the melting snows
in the mountains. August is a rainy month, the time of harvest;
night-frosts may begin already about the middle of the month.
All preparations for winter are made during September and
October, and full winter has set in by November.</p>

<p><i>The Lapps.</i>&mdash;The Lapps (Swed. <i>Lappar</i>; Russian <i>Lopari</i>;
Norw. <i>Finner</i>) call their country <i>Sabme</i> or <i>Same</i>, and themselves
<i>Samelats</i>&mdash;names almost identical with those employed by the
Finns for their country and race, and probably connected with
a root signifying &ldquo;dark.&rdquo; Lapp is almost certainly a nickname
imposed by foreigners, although some of the Lapps apply it
contemptuously to those of their countrymen whom they think
to be less civilized than themselves.<a name="fa1j" id="fa1j" href="#ft1j"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>In Sweden and Finland the Lapps are usually divided into
fisher, mountain and forest Lapps. In Sweden the first class
includes many impoverished mountain Lapps. As described
by Laestadius (1827-1832), their condition was very miserable;
but since his time matters have improved. The principal colony
has its summer quarters on the Stora-Lule Lake, possesses good
boats and nets, and, besides catching and drying fish, makes
money by the shooting of wild fowl and the gathering of eggs.
When he has acquired a little means it is not unusual for the
fisher to settle down and reclaim a bit of land. The mountain
and forest Lapps are the true representatives of the race. In
the wandering life of the mountain Lapp his autumn residence,
on the borders of the forest district, may be considered as the
central point; it is there that he erects his <i>njalla</i>, a small wooden
storehouse raised high above the ground by one or more piles.
About the beginning of November he begins to wander south or
east into the forest land, and in the winter he may visit, not only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>204</span>
such places as Jokkmokk and Arjepluog, but even Gefle, Upsala
or Stockholm. About the beginning of May he is back at his
njalla, but as soon as the weather grows warm he pushes up to
the mountains, and there throughout the summer pastures
his herds and prepares his store of cheese. By autumn or
October he is busy at his njalla killing the surplus reindeer
bulls and curing meat for the winter. From the mountain
Lapp the forest (or, as he used to be called, the spruce-fir) Lapp
is mainly distinguished by the narrower limits within which
he pursues his nomadic life. He never wanders outside of a
certain district, in which he possesses hereditary rights, and
maintains a series of camping-grounds which he visits in regular
rotation. In May or April he lets his reindeer loose, to wander
as they please; but immediately after midsummer, when the
mosquitoes become troublesome, he goes to collect them.
Catching a single deer and belling it, he drives it through the
wood; the other deer, whose instinct leads them to gather
into herds for mutual protection against the mosquitoes, are
attracted by the sound. Should the summer be very cool and
the mosquitoes few, the Lapp finds it next to impossible to bring
the creatures together. About the end of August they are
again let loose, but they are once more collected in October,
the forest Lapp during winter pursuing the same course of life
as the mountain Lapp.</p>

<p>In Norway there are three classes&mdash;the sea Lapps, the river
Lapps and the mountain Lapps, the first two settled, the third
nomadic. The mountain Lapps have a rather ruder and harder
life than the same class in Sweden. About Christmas those of
Kautokeino and Karasjok are usually settled in the neighbourhood
of the churches; in summer they visit the coast, and in autumn
they return inland. Previous to 1852, when they were forbidden
by imperial decree, they were wont in winter to move south across
the Russian frontiers. It is seldom possible for them to remain
more than three or four days in one spot. Flesh is their favourite,
in winter almost their only food, though they also use reindeer
milk, cheese and rye or barley cakes. The sea Lapps are in
some respects hardly to be distinguished from the other coast
dwellers of Finmark. Their food consists mainly of cooked
fish. The river Lapps, many of whom, however, are descendants
of Finns proper, breed cattle, attempt a little tillage and entrust
their reindeer to the care of mountain Lapps.</p>

<p>In Finland there are comparatively few Laplanders, and the
great bulk of them belong to the fisher class. Many are settled
in the neighbourhood of the Enare Lake. In the spring they go
down to the Norwegian coast and take part in the sea fisheries,
returning to the lake about midsummer. Formerly they found
the capture of wild reindeer a profitable occupation, using for
this purpose a palisaded avenue gradually narrowing towards
a pitfall.</p>

<p>The Russian Lapps are also for the most part fishers, as is
natural in a district with such an extent of coast and such a
number of lakes, not to mention the advantage which the fisher
has over the reindeer keeper in connexion with the many fasts
of the Greek Church. They maintain a half nomadic life, very
few having become settlers in the Russian villages. It is usual
to distinguish them according to the district of the coast which
they frequent, as Murman (Murmanski) and Terian (Terski)
Lapps. A separate tribe, the Filmans, <i>i.e.</i> Finnmans, wander
about the Pazyets, Motov and Pechenga tundras, and retain
the peculiar dialect and the Lutheran creed which they owe to
a former connexion with Sweden. They were formerly known
as the &ldquo;twice and thrice tributary&rdquo; Lapps, because they paid
to two or even three states&mdash;Russia, Denmark and Sweden.</p>

<p>The Lapps within the historical period have considerably
recruited themselves from neighbouring races. Shortness of
stature<a name="fa2j" id="fa2j" href="#ft2j"><span class="sp">2</span></a> is their most obvious characteristic, though in regard
to this much exaggeration has prevailed. Düben found an
average of 4.9 ft. for males and a little less for females; Mantegazza,
who made a number of anthropological observations in
Norway in 1879, gives 5 ft. and 4.75 ft., respectively (<i>Archivio
per l&rsquo;antrop.</i>, 1880). Individuals much above or much below
the average are rare. The body is usually of fair proportions,
but the legs are rather short, and in many cases somewhat bandy.
Dark, swarthy, yellow, copper-coloured are all adjectives
employed to describe their complexion&mdash;the truth being that
their habits of life do not conduce either to the preservation or
display of the natural colour of their skin, and that some of
them are really fair, and others, perhaps the majority, really
dark. The colour of the hair ranges from blonde and reddish
to a bluish or greyish black; the eyes are black, hazel, blue
or grey. The shape of the skull is the most striking peculiarity
of the Lapp. He is the most brachycephalous type of man in
Europe, perhaps in the world.<a name="fa3j" id="fa3j" href="#ft3j"><span class="sp">3</span></a> According to Virchow, the
women in width of face are more Mongolian in type than the
men, but neither in men nor women does the opening of the
eye show any true obliquity. In children the eye is large,
open and round. The nose is always low and broad, more
markedly retroussé among the females than the males. Wrinkled
and puckered by exposure to the weather, the faces even of
the younger Lapps assume an appearance of old age. The
muscular system is usually well developed, but there is deficiency
of fatty tissue, which affects the features (particularly by giving
relative prominence to the eyes) and the general character
of the skin. The thinness of the skin, indeed, can but rarely be
paralleled among other Europeans. Among the Lapps, as among
other lower races, the index is shorter than the ring finger.</p>

<p>The Lapps are a quiet, inoffensive people. Crimes of violence
are almost unknown, and the only common breach of law is the
killing of tame reindeer belonging to other owners. In Russia,
however, they have a bad reputation for lying and general
untrustworthiness, and drunkenness is well-nigh a universal vice.
In Scandinavia laws have been directed against the importation
of intoxicating liquors into the Lapp country since 1723.</p>

<p>Superficially at least the great bulk of the Lapps have been
Christianized&mdash;those of the Scandinavian countries being Protestants,
those of Russia members of the Greek Church. Although
the first attempt to convert the Lapps to Christianity
seems to have been made in the 11th century, the worship of
heathen idols was carried on openly in Swedish Lappmark as
late as 1687, and secretly in Norway down to the first quarter
of the 18th century, while the practices of heathen rites survived
into the 19th century, if indeed they are extinct even yet. Lapp
graves, prepared in the heathen manner, have been discovered
in upper Namdal (Norway), belonging to the years 1820 and
1826. In education the Scandinavian Lapps are far ahead of
their Russian brethren, to whom reading and writing are arts
as unfamiliar as they were to their pagan ancestors. The
general manner of life is patriarchal. The father of the family
has complete authority over all its affairs; and on his death this
authority passes to the eldest son. Parents are free to disinherit
their children; and, if a son separates from the family without
his father&rsquo;s permission, he receives no share of the property
except a gun and his wife&rsquo;s dowry.<a name="fa4j" id="fa4j" href="#ft4j"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p>The Lapps are of necessity conservative in most of their habits,
many of which can hardly have altered since the first taming of
the reindeer. But the strong current of mercantile enterprise
has carried a few important products of southern civilization into
their huts. The lines in which James Thomson describes their
simple life&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem f90"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>The reindeer form their riches: these their tents,</p>
<p>Their robes, their beds, and all their homely wealth</p>
<p>Supply; their wholesome fare and cheerful cups&mdash;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">are still applicable in the main to the mountain Lapps; but
even they have learned to use coffee as an ordinary beverage
and to wear stout Norwegian cloth (<i>vadmal</i>).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Linguistically the Lapps belong to the Finno-Ugrian group
(<i>q.v.</i>); the similarity of their speech to Finnish is evident though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>205</span>
the phonetics are different and more complicated. It is broken up
into very distinct and even mutually unintelligible dialects, the
origin of several of which is, however, easily found in the political
and social dismemberment of the people. Düben distinguishes
four leading dialects; but a much greater number are recognizable.
In Russian Lapland alone there are three, due to the influence of
Norwegian, Karelian and Russian (Lönnrot, <i>Acta Soc. Sci. Fennicae</i>,
vol. iv.). &ldquo;The Lapps,&rdquo; says Castren, &ldquo;have had the misfortune
to come into close contact with foreign races while their language
was yet in its tenderest infancy, and consequently it has not only
adopted an endless number of foreign words, but in many grammatical
aspects fashioned itself after foreign models.&rdquo; That it
began at a very early period to enrich itself with Scandinavian
words is shown by the use it still makes of forms belonging to a
<span class="sidenote">Language.</span>
linguistic stage older even than that of Icelandic. Düben
has subjected the vocabulary to a very interesting analysis
for the purpose of discovering what stage of culture the people had
reached before their contact with the Norse. Agricultural terms,
the names of the metals and the word for smith are all of Scandinavian
origin, and the words for &ldquo;taming&rdquo; and &ldquo;milk&rdquo; would
suggest that the southern strangers taught the Lapps how to turn
the reindeer to full account. The important place, however, which
this creature must always have held in their estimation is evident
from the existence of more than three hundred native words in connexion
with reindeer.</p>

<p>The Lapp tongue was long ago reduced to writing by the missionaries;
but very little has been printed in it except school-books and
religious works. A number of popular tales and songs, indeed, have
been taken down from the lips of the people. The songs are similar
to those of the Finns, and a process of mutual borrowing seems to
have gone on. In one of the saga-like pieces&mdash;Pishan-Peshan&rsquo;s son&mdash;there
seems to be a mention of the Baikal Lake, and possibly also
of the Altai Mountains. The story of Njavvisena, daughter of the
Sun, is full of quaint folk-lore about the taming of the reindeer.
Giants, as well as a blind or one-eyed monster, are frequently introduced,
and the Aesopic fable is not without its representatives.
Many of the Lapps are able to speak one or even two of the neighbouring
tongues.</p>

<p>The reputation of the Laplanders for skill in magic and divination
is of very early date, and in Finland is not yet extinct. When Erik
Blood-axe, son of Harold Haarfager, visited Bjarmaland in 922, he
found Gunhild, daughter of Asur Tote, living among the Lapps, to
whom she had been sent by her father for the purpose of being
trained in witchcraft; and Ivan the Terrible of Russia sent for
magicians from Lapland to explain the cause of the appearance of a
comet. One of the powers with which they were formerly credited
was that of raising winds. &ldquo;They tye three knottes,&rdquo; says old
Richard Eden, &ldquo;on a strynge hangyng at a whyp. When they lose
one of these they rayse tollerable wynds. When they lose an other
the wynde is more vehement; but by losing the thyrd they rayse
playne tempestes as in old tyme they were accustomed to rayse
thunder and lyghtnyng&rdquo; (<i>Hist. of Trauayle</i>, 1577). Though we are
familiar in English with allusions to &ldquo;Lapland witches,&rdquo; it appears
that the art, according to native custom, was in the hands of the
men. During his divination the wizard fell into a state of trance or
<span class="sidenote">Witchcraft.</span>
ecstasy, his soul being held to run at large to pursue its
inquiries. Great use was made of a curious divining-drum,
oval in shape and made of wood, 1 to 4 ft. in length.
Over the upper surface was stretched a white-dressed reindeer skin,
and at the corners (so to speak) hung a variety of charms&mdash;tufts of
wool, bones, teeth, claws, &amp;c. The area was divided into several
spaces, often into three, one for the celestial gods, one for the
terrestrial and one for man. A variety of figures and conventional
signs were drawn in the several compartments: the sun, for instance,
is frequently represented by a square and a stroke from each
corner, Thor by two hammers placed crosswise; and in the more
modern specimens symbols for Christ, the Virgin, and the Holy
Ghost are introduced. An <i>arpa</i> or divining-rod was laid on a
definite spot, the drum beaten by a hammer, and conclusions drawn
from the position taken up by the arpa. Any Lapp who had attained
to manhood could in ordinary circumstances consult the drum for
himself, but in matters of unusual moment the professional wizard
(<i>naid</i>, <i>noide</i> or <i>noaide</i>) had to be called in.</p>
</div>

<p><i>History</i>.&mdash;The Lapps have a dim tradition that their ancestors
lived in a far eastern land, and they tell rude stories of conflicts
with Norsemen and Karelians. But no answer can be obtained
from them in regard to their early distribution and movements.
It has been maintained that they were formerly spread over the
whole of the Scandinavian peninsula, and they have even been
considered the remnants of that primeval race of cave-dwellers
which hunted the reindeer over the snow-fields of central and
western Europe. But much of the evidence adduced for these
theories is highly questionable. The contents of the so-called
Lapps&rsquo; graves found in various parts of Scandinavia are often
sufficient in themselves to show that the appellation must be a
misnomer, and the syllable Lap or Lapp found in many names
of places can often be proved to have no connexion with the
Lapps.<a name="fa5j" id="fa5j" href="#ft5j"><span class="sp">5</span></a> They occupied their present territory when they are
first mentioned in history. According to Düben the name first
occurs in the 13th century&mdash;in the <i>Fundinn Noregr</i>, composed
about 1200, in Saxo Grammaticus, and in a papal bull of date
1230; but the people are probably to be identified with those
Finns of Tacitus whom he describes as wild hunters with skins
for clothing and rude huts as only means of shelter, and certainly
with the Skrithiphinoi of Procopius (<i>Goth.</i> ii. 15), the Scritobini
of Paulus Warnefridus, and the Scridifinni of the geographer of
Ravenna. Some of the details given by Procopius, in regard
for instance to the treatment of infants, show that his informant
was acquainted with certain characteristic customs of the Lapps.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In the 9th century the Norsemen from Norway began to treat
their feeble northern neighbours as a subject race. The wealth of
Ottar, &ldquo;northmost of the northmen,&rdquo; whose narrative has been
preserved by King Alfred, consisted mainly of six hundred of those
&ldquo;deer they call hrenas&rdquo; and in tribute paid by the natives; and
the Eigils saga tells how Brynjulf Bjargulfson had his right to
collect contributions from the Finns (<i>i.e.</i> the Lapps) recognized by
Harold Haarfager. So much value was attached to this source of
wealth that as early as 1050 strangers were excluded from the fur-trade
of Finmark, and a kind of coast-guard prevented their intrusion.
<span class="correction" title="amended from Meantine">Meantime</span> the Karelians were pressing on the eastern Lapps, and
in the course of the 11th century the rulers of Novgorod began to
treat them as the Norsemen had treated their western brethren.
The ground-swell of the Tatar invasion drove the Karelians westward
in the 13th century, and for many years even Finmark was so
unsettled that the Norsemen received no tribute from the Lapps.
At length in 1326 a treaty was concluded between Norway and
Russia by which the supremacy of the Norwegians over the Lapps
was recognized as far east as Voljo beyond Kandalax on the White
Sea, and the supremacy of the Russians over the Karelians as far
as Lyngen and the Målself. The relations of the Lapps to their
more powerful neighbours were complicated by the rivalry of the
different Scandinavian kingdoms. After the disruption of the
Calmar Union (1523) Sweden began to assert its rights with vigour,
and in 1595 the treaty of Teusina between Sweden and Russia
decreed &ldquo;that the Lapps who dwell in the woods between eastern
Bothnia and Varanger shall pay their dues to the king of Sweden.&rdquo;
It was in vain that Christian IV. of Denmark visited Kola and
exacted homage in 1599, and every year sent messengers to protest
against the collection of his tribute by the Swedes (a custom which
continued down to 1806). Charles of Sweden took the title of &ldquo;king
of the Kajans and Lapps,&rdquo; and left no means untried to establish
his power over all Scandinavian Lapland. By the peace of Knäröd
(1613) Gustavus Adolphus gave up the Swedish claim to Finmark;
and in 1751 mutual renunciations brought the relations of Swedish
and Norwegian (Danish) Lapland to their present position. Meanwhile
Russian influence had been spreading westward; and in
1809, when Alexander I. finally obtained the cession of Finland, he
also added to his dominions the whole of Finnish Lapland to the
east of the Muonio and the Köngämä. It may be interesting to
mention that Lapps, armed with bows and arrows, were attached
to certain regiments of Gustavus Adolphus in Germany during the
Thirty Years&rsquo; War.</p>

<p>The Lapps have had the ordinary fate of a subject and defenceless
people; they have been utilized with little regard to their own
interest or inclinations. The example set by the early Norwegians
was followed by the Swedes: a peculiar class of adventurers known
as the Birkarlians (from <i>Bjark</i> or <i>Birk</i>, &ldquo;trade&rdquo;) began in the 13th
century to farm the Lapps, and, receiving very extensive privileges
from the kings, grew to great wealth and influence. In 1606 there
were twenty-two Birkarlians in Tornio, seventeen in Lule, sixteen
in Pite, and sixty-six in Ume Lappmark. They are regularly spoken
of as having or owning Lapps, whom they dispose of as any other
piece of property. In Russian Lapland matters followed much the
same course. The very institutions of the Solovets monastery, intended
by St Tryphon for the benefit of the poor neglected pagans,
turned out the occasion of much injustice towards them. By a
charter of Ivan Vasilivitch (November 1556), the monks are declared
masters of the Lapps of the Motoff and Petchenga districts, and
they soon sought to extend their control over those not legally
assigned to them (Ephimenko). Other monasteries were gifted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>206</span>
with similar proprietary rights; and the supplication of the patriarch
Nikon to Alexis Mikhaelovitch, for example, shows clearly the
oppression to which the Lapps were subjected.</p>

<p>It is long, however, since these abuses were abolished; and in
Scandinavia more especially the Lapps of the present day enjoy the
advantages resulting from a large amount of philanthropic legislation
on the part of their rulers. There seems to be no fear of their
becoming extinct, except it may be by gradual amalgamation with
their more powerful neighbours. In Norway the total number of
Lapps was 20,786 in 1891, and in Sweden in 1904 it was officially
estimated that there were 7000. Add to these some 3000 for Russian
Lapland, and the total Lapp population approximates to 30,000.
In Sweden the Lapps are gradually abandoning their nomadic
habits and becoming merged in the Swedish population. The
majority of the Norwegian Lapps lead a semi-nomadic existence;
but the number of inveterate nomads can scarcely reach 1500 at
the present day. In Sweden there are about 3500 nomads.</p>

missionary work see Stockfleth, <i>Dagbog over mine missions Reiser</i>

It was not until 1840 that the New Testament was translated into
Norwegian Lappish, and not until 1895 that the entire Bible was
printed in the same dialect. In the Russian dialect of Lappish
there exist only two versions of St Matthew&rsquo;s gospel.</p>

been driven back by the Swedes and Norwegians is disproved by
the recent investigations of Yngvar Nielsen, K. B. Wiklund and
others. The fact is, the Lapps are increasing in numbers, as well
as pushing their way farther and farther south. In the beginning
of the 16th century their southern border-line in Norway ran on the
upper side of 64° N. In 1890 they forced their way to the head of the
Hardanger Fjord in 60° N. In Sweden the presence of Lapps as far
south as Jämtland (or Jemtland) is first mentioned in 1564. In
1881 they pushed on into the north of Dalecarlia, about 61° 45&prime; N.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA PLATA,<a name="ar147" id="ar147"></a></span> a city of Argentina and capital of the province
of Buenos Aires, 5 m. inland from the port of Ensenada, or La
Plata, and about 31 m. S.E. of the city of Buenos Aires, with
which it is connected by rail. Pop. (1895) 45,609; (1907,
estimate) 84,000. La Plata was founded in 1882, two years
after Buenos Aires had been constituted a federal district and
made the national capital. This necessitated the selection of
another provincial capital, which resulted in the choice of an
open plain near the former port of Ensenada de Barragán, on
which a city was laid out after the plan of Washington. The
streets are so wide that they seem out of proportion to the low
brick buildings. The principal public buildings, constructed of
brick and stucco, are the government-house, assembly building,
treasury, municipal hall, cathedral, courts of justice, police
headquarters, provincial museum and railway station. The
museum, originally presented by Dr Moreno, has become one
of the most important in South America, its palaeontological
and anthropological collections being unique. There are also
a university, national college, public library, astronomical
observatory, several churches, two hospitals and two theatres.
A noteworthy public park is formed by a large plantation of
eucalyptus trees, which have grown to a great height and present
an imposing appearance on the level, treeless plain. Electricity
is in general use for public and private lighting, and tramways
are laid down in the principal streets and extend eastward to
the port. The harbour of the port of La Plata consists of a large
artificial basin, 1450 yds. long by 150 yds. wide, with approaches,
in addition to the old port of Ensenada, which are capable of
receiving the largest vessels that can navigate the La Plata
estuary. Up to the opening of the new port works of Buenos
Aires a large part of the ocean-going traffic of Buenos Aires
passed through the port of La Plata. It has good railway connexions
with the interior, and exports cattle and agricultural
produce.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAPORTE, ROLAND<a name="ar148" id="ar148"></a></span> (1675-1704), Camisard leader, better
known as &ldquo;Roland,&rdquo; was born at Mas Soubeyran (Gard) in
a cottage which has become the property of the Société de
l&rsquo;Histoire du Protestantisme français, and which contains relics
of the hero. He was a nephew of Laporte, the Camisard leader
who was hunted down and shot in October 1702, and he himself
became the leader of a band of a thousand men which he formed
into a disciplined army with magazines, arsenals and hospitals.
For daring in action and rapidity of movement he was second
only to Cavalier. These two leaders in 1702 secured entrance
to the town of Sauve under the pretence of being royal officers,
burnt the church and carried off provisions and ammunition for
their forces. Roland, who called himself &ldquo;general of the children
of God,&rdquo; terrorized the country between Nîmes and Alais, burning
churches and houses, and slaying those suspected of hostility
against the Huguenots, though without personally taking any
part of the spoil. Cavalier was already in negotiation with
Marshal Villars when Roland cut to pieces a Catholic regiment
at Fontmorte in May 1704. He refused to lay down his arms
without definite assurance of the restoration of the privileges
accorded by the Edict of Nantes. Villars then sought to
negotiate, offering Roland the command of a regiment on foreign
service and liberty of conscience, though not the free exercise
of their religion, for his co-religionists. This parley had no
results, but Roland was betrayed to his enemies, and on the 14th
of August 1704 was shot while defending himself against his
captors. The five officers who were with him surrendered,
and were broken on the wheel at Nîmes. Roland&rsquo;s death put
an end to the effective resistance of the Cévenols.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA PORTE,<a name="ar149" id="ar149"></a></span> a city and the county seat of La Porte county,
Indiana, U.S.A., 12 m. S. of Lake Michigan and about 60 m.
S.E. of Chicago. Pop. (1890) 7126; (1900) 7113 (1403 foreign-born);
(1910) 10,525. It is served by the Lake Erie &amp;
Western, the Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern, the Père
Marquette, the Chicago, South Bend &amp; Northern Indiana
(electric), and the Chicago-New York Electric Air Line railways.
La Porte lies in the midst of a fertile agricultural region, and the
shipment of farm and orchard products is one of its chief industries.
There are also numerous manufactures. La Porte&rsquo;s
situation in the heart of a region of beautiful lakes (including
Clear, Pine and Stone lakes) has given it a considerable reputation
as a summer resort. The lakes furnish a large supply of clear ice,
which is shipped to the Chicago markets. La Porte was settled
in 1830, laid out in 1833, incorporated as a town in 1835, and
first chartered as a city in 1852.</p>

French geologist, was born at Bourges on the 30th of December
1839. After studying at the École Polytechnique from 1858 to
1860 he became <i>ingénieur au corps des mines</i>, and took part in
drawing up the geological map of France; and in 1875 he was
appointed professor of geology and mineralogy at the Catholic
Institute, Paris. In 1879 he prepared an important memoir
for the geological survey of France on <i>Le Pays de Bray</i>, a subject
on which he had already published several memoirs, and in 1880
he served as president of the French Geological Society. In
1881-1883 he published his <i>Traité de géologie</i> (5th ed., 1905),
the best European text-book of stratigraphical geology. His
other works include <i>Cours de minéralogie</i> (1884, 3rd ed., 1899),
<i>La Formation des combustibles minéraux</i> (1886), <i>Le Niveau de la

<p><span class="bold">LAPPENBERG, JOHANN MARTIN<a name="ar152" id="ar152"></a></span> (1794-1865), German
historian, was born on the 30th of July 1794 at Hamburg, where
his father, Valentin Anton Lappenberg (1759-1819), held an
official position. He studied medicine, and afterwards history,
at Edinburgh. He continued to study history in London, and at
Berlin and Göttingen, graduating as doctor of laws at Göttingen
in 1816. In 1820 he was sent by the Hamburg senate as resident
minister to the Prussian court. In 1823 he became keeper of
the Hamburg archives; an office in which he had the fullest
opportunities for the laborious and critical research work upon
which his reputation as an historian rests. He retained this
post until 1863, when a serious affection of the eyes compelled
him to resign. In 1850 he represented Hamburg in the German
parliament at Frankfort, and bis death took place at Hamburg
on the 28th of November 1865. Lappenberg&rsquo;s most important
work is his <i>Geschichte von England</i>, which deals with the history
of England from the earliest times to 1154, and was published
in two volumes at Hamburg in 1834-1837. It has been translated
into English by B. Thorpe as <i>History of England under the
Anglo-Saxon Kings</i> (London 1845, and again 1881), and <i>History
of England under the Norman Kings</i> (Oxford, 1857), and has been
continued in three additional volumes from 1154 to 1509 by
R. Pauli. His other works deal mainly with the history of
Hamburg, and include <i>Hamburgische Chroniken in Niedersächsischer
Sprache</i> (Hamburg, 1852-1861); <i>Geschichtsquellen des
Erzstiftes und der Stadt Bremen</i> (Bremen, 1841); <i>Hamburgisches
Urkundenbuch</i> (Hamburg, 1842); <i>Urkundliche Geschichte des
Hansischen Stahlhofes zu London</i> (Hamburg, 1851); <i>Hamburgische
Rechtsalterthümer</i> (Hamburg, 1845); and <i>Urkundliche
Geschichte des Ursprunges der deutschen Hanse</i> (Hamburg, 1830),
a continuation of the work of G. F. Sartorius. For the <i>Monumenta
Germaniae historica</i> he edited the <i>Chronicon</i> of Thietmar
of Merseburg, the <i>Gesta Hammenburgensis ecclesiae pontificum</i>
of Adam of Bremen and the <i>Chronica Slavorum</i> of Helmold,
with its continuation by Arnold of Lübeck. Lappenberg, who
was a member of numerous learned societies in Europe, wrote
many other historical works.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAPRADE, PIERRE MARTIN VICTOR RICHARD DE<a name="ar153" id="ar153"></a></span> (1812-1883),
known as <span class="sc">Victor de Laprade</span>, French poet and critic,
was born on the 13th of January 1812 at Montbrison, in the
department of the Loire. He came of a modest provincial
family. After completing his studies at Lyons, he produced in
1839 a small volume of religious verse, <i>Les Parfums de Madeleine</i>.
This was followed in 1840 by <i>La Colère de Jésus</i>, in 1841 by the
religious fantasy of <i>Psyché</i>, and in 1844 by <i>Odes et poèmes</i>.
In 1845 Laprade visited Italy on a mission of literary research,
and in 1847 he was appointed professor of French literature at
Lyons. The French Academy, by a single vote, preferred
Émile Augier at the election in 1857, but in the following year
Laprade was chosen to fill the chair of Alfred de Musset. In
1861 he was removed from his post at Lyons owing to the
publication of a political satire in verse (<i>Les Muses d&rsquo;État</i>), and
in 1871 took his seat in the National Assembly on the benches
of the Right. He died on the 13th of December 1883. A
statue has been raised by his fellow-townsmen at Montbrison.
Besides those named above, Laprade&rsquo;s poetical works include
<i>Poèmes évangéliques</i> (1852), <i>Idylles héroïques</i> (1858), <i>Les Voix de
silence</i> (1864), <i>Pernette</i> (1868), <i>Poèmes civiles</i> (1873), <i>Le Livre
d&rsquo;un père</i> (1877), <i>Varia</i> and <i>Livre des adieux</i> (1878-1879). In
prose he published, in 1840, <i>Des habitudes intellectuelles de
l&rsquo;avocat</i>. <i>Questions d&rsquo;art et de morale</i> appeared in 1861, succeeded
by <i>Le Sentiment de la nature, avant le Christianisme</i> in 1866, and
<i>Chez les modernes</i> in 1868, <i>Éducation libérale</i> in 1873. The
material for these books had in some cases been printed earlier,
after delivery as a lecture. He also contributed articles to the
<i>Revue des deux mondes</i> and the <i>Revue de Paris</i>. No writer
represents more perfectly than Laprade the admirable genius
of French provincial life, its homely simplicity, its culture, its
piety and its sober patriotism. As a poet he belongs to the
school of Chateaubriand and Lamartine. Devoted to the best
classical models, inspired by a sense of the ideal, and by worship
of nature as revealing the divine&mdash;gifted, too, with a full faculty of
expression&mdash;he lacked only fire and passion in the equipment
of a romantic poet. But the want of these, and the pressure of a
certain chilly facility and of a too conscious philosophizing have
prevented him from reaching the first rank, or from even attaining
the popularity due to his high place in the second. Only
in his patriotic verse did he shake himself clear from these
trammels. Speaking generally, he possessed some of the qualities,
and many of the defects, of the English Lake School. Laprade&rsquo;s
prose criticisms must be ranked high. Apart from his classical
and metaphysical studies, he was widely read in the literatures of
Europe, and built upon the groundwork of a naturally correct
taste. His dislike of irony and scepticism probably led him
to underrate the product of the 18th century, and there are signs
of a too fastidious dread of Philistinism. But a constant love
of the best, a joy in nature and a lofty patriotism are not less
evident than in his poetry. Few writers of any nation have
fixed their minds so steadily on whatsoever things are pure, and
lovely and of good report.</p>

in several senses. (1) In ecclesiastical law, when a patron has

In such case the patronage or right of presentation devolves
from the neglectful patron to the bishop as ordinary, to the

<p><span class="bold">LAPWING<a name="ar155" id="ar155"></a></span> (O.Eng. <i>hleápewince</i> = &ldquo;one who turns about in
running or flight&rdquo;),<a name="fa1k" id="fa1k" href="#ft1k"><span class="sp">1</span></a> a bird, the <i>Tringa vanellus</i> of Linnaeus
and the <i>Vanellus vulgaris</i> or <i>V. cristatus</i> of modern ornithologists.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>208</span>
In the temperate parts of the Old World this species is perhaps
the most abundant of the plovers, <i>Charadriidae</i>, breeding in
almost every suitable place from Ireland to Japan&mdash;the majority
migrating towards winter to southern countries, as the Punjab,
Egypt and Barbary&mdash;though in the British Islands some are
always found at that season. As a straggler it has occurred
within the Arctic Circle (as on the Varanger Fjord in Norway), as
well as in Iceland and even Greenland; while it not unfrequently
appears in Madeira and the Azores. Conspicuous as the strongly
contrasted colours of its plumage and its very peculiar flight
make it, it is remarkable that it maintains its ground when so
many of its allies have been almost exterminated, for the lapwing
is the object perhaps of greater persecution than any other
European bird that is not a plunderer. Its eggs are the well-known
&ldquo;plovers&rsquo; eggs&rdquo; of commerce,<a name="fa2k" id="fa2k" href="#ft2k"><span class="sp">2</span></a> and the bird, wary and
wild at other times of the year, in the breeding-season becomes
easily approachable, and is shot to be sold in the markets for
&ldquo;golden plover.&rdquo; Its growing scarcity in Great Britain was very
perceptible until the various acts for the protection of wild birds
were passed. It is now abundant and is of service both for the
market and to agriculture. What seems to be the secret of the
lapwing holding its position is the adaptability of its nature to
various kinds of localities. It will find sustenance equally on the
driest of soils as on the fattest pastures; upland and fen, arable
and moorland, are alike to it, provided only the ground be open
enough. The wailing cry<a name="fa3k" id="fa3k" href="#ft3k"><span class="sp">3</span></a> and the frantic gestures of the cock
bird in the breeding-season will tell any passer-by that a nest
or brood is near; but, unless he knows how to look for it, nothing
save mere chance will enable him to find it. The nest is a slight
hollow in the ground, wonderfully inconspicuous even when
deepened, as is usually the case, by incubation, and the black-spotted
olive eggs (four in number) are almost invisible to the
careless or untrained eye. The young when first hatched are
clothed with mottled down, so as closely to resemble a stone,
and to be overlooked as they squat motionless on the approach
of danger. At a distance the plumage of the adult appears
to be white and black in about equal proportions, the latter
predominating above; but on closer examination nearly all
the seeming black is found to be a bottle-green gleaming with
purple and copper; the tail-coverts, both above and below,
are of a bright bay colour, seldom visible in flight. The crest
consists of six or eight narrow and elongated feathers, turned
slightly upwards at the end, and is usually carried in a horizontal
position, extending in the cock beyond the middle of the back;
but it is capable of being erected so as to become nearly vertical.
Frequenting parts of the open country so very divergent in
character, and as remarkable for the peculiarity of its flight
as for that of its cry, the lapwing is far more often observed in
nearly all parts of the British Islands than any other of the
group Limicolae. The peculiarity of its flight seems due to the
wide and rounded wings it possesses, the steady and ordinarily
somewhat slow flapping of which impels the body at each
stroke with a manifest though easy jerk. Yet on occasion, as
when performing its migrations, or even its almost daily transits
from one feeding-ground to another, and still more when being
pursued by a falcon, the speed with which it moves through
the air is very considerable. On the ground this bird runs
nimbly, and is nearly always engaged in searching for its food,
which is wholly animal.</p>

<p>Allied to the lapwing are several forms that have been placed
by ornithologists in the genera <i>Hoplopterus</i>, <i>Chettusia</i>, <i>Lobivanellus</i>,
<i>Defilippia</i>. In some of them the hind toe, which has
already ceased to have any function in the lapwing, is wholly
wanting. In others the wings are armed with a tubercle or even
a sharp spur on the carpus. Few have any occipital crest, but
several have the face ornamented by the outgrowth of a fleshy
lobe or lobes. With the exception of North America, they
are found in most parts of the world, but perhaps the greater
number in Africa. Europe has three species&mdash;<i>Hoplopterus
spinosus</i>, the spur-winged plover, and <i>Chettusia gregaria</i> and <i>C.
leucura</i>; but the first and last are only stragglers from Africa
and Asia.</p>

redshank, of the golden plover (to a small extent), and enormous
numbers of those of the black-headed gull, and in certain places of
some of the terns are, however, sold as lapwings&rsquo;, having a certain

known in the districts it frequents. In Sweden <i>Vipa</i>, in Germany
<i>Kiebitz</i>, in Holland <i>Kiewiet</i>, and in France <i>Dixhuit</i>, are names of
the lapwing, given to it from its usual cry. Other English names are
green plover and hornpie&mdash;the latter from its long hornlike crest and
pied plumage. The lapwing&rsquo;s conspicuous crest seems to have been
the cause of a common blunder among English writers of the middle
ages, who translated the Latin word <i>Upupa</i>, property hoopoe, by
lapwing, as being the crested bird with which they were best acquainted.
In like manner other writers of the same or an earlier
period latinized lapwing by <i>Egrettides</i> (plural), and rendered that
again into English as egrets&mdash;the tuft of feathers misleading them
also. The word <i>Vanellus</i> is from <i>vannus</i>, the fan used for winnowing
corn, and refers to the audible beating of the bird&rsquo;s wings.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAPWORTH, CHARLES<a name="ar156" id="ar156"></a></span> (1842-&emsp;&emsp;), English geologist, was
born at Faringdon in Berkshire on the 30th of September 1842.
He was educated partly in the village of Buckland in the
same county, and afterwards in the training college at Culham,
near Oxford (1862-1864). He was then appointed master in
a school connected with the Episcopal church at Galashiels,
where he remained eleven years. Geology came to absorb
all his leisure time, and he commenced to investigate the Silurian
rocks of the Southern Uplands, and to study the graptolites
and other fossils which mark horizons in the great series of Lower
Palaeozoic rocks. His first paper on the Lower Silurian rocks
of Galashiels was published in 1870, and from that date onwards
he continued to enrich our knowledge of the southern uplands
of Scotland until the publication by the Geological Society of
his masterly papers on <i>The Moffat Series</i> (1878) and <i>The Girvan
Succession</i> (1882). Meanwhile in 1875 he became an assistant
master in the Madras College, St Andrews, and in 1881 professor
of geology and mineralogy (afterwards geology and physiography)
in the Mason College, now University of Birmingham. In 1882
he started work in the Durness-Eriboll district of the Scottish
Highlands, and made out the true succession of the rocks, and
interpreted the complicated structure which had baffled most
of the previous observers. His results were published in &ldquo;The
Secret of the Highlands&rdquo; (<i>Geol. Mag.</i>, 1883). His subsequent
work includes papers on the Cambrian rocks of Nuneaton and
the Ordovician rocks of Shropshire. The term Ordovician was
introduced by him in 1879 for the strata between the base of
the Lower Llandovery formation and that of the Lower Arenig;
and it was intended to settle the confusion arising from the use
by some writers of Lower Silurian and by others of Upper
Cambrian for the same set of rocks. The term Ordovician is
now generally adopted. Professor Lapworth was elected F.R.S.
in 1888, he received a royal medal in 1891, and was awarded
the Wollaston medal by the Geological Society in 1899. He
was president of the Geological Society, 1902-1904. His <i>Intermediate
Text-book of Geology</i> was published in 1899.</p>

Caribbean. Pop. (1905 estimate) 272,252. The greater part of
its surface is mountainous, with elevated fertile valleys which
have a temperate climate. The Tocuyo river rises in the S.W.
angle of the state and flows N.E. to the Caribbean with a total
length of 287 m. A narrow-gauge railway, the &ldquo;South-western,&rdquo;
owned by British capitalists, runs from the port of Tucacas 55 m.
S.W. to Barquisimeto by way of the Aroa copper-mining district.
Lara produces wheat and other cereals, coffee, sugar, tobacco,
neat cattle, sheep and various mineral ores, including silver,
copper, iron, lead, bismuth and antimony. The capital, Barquisimeto,
is one of the largest and most progressive of the inland
cities of Venezuela. Carora is also prominent as a commercial
centre. Tocuyo (pop. in 1891, 15,383), 40 m. S.W. of Barquisimeto,
is an important commercial and mining town, over 2000 ft.
above sea-level, in the midst of a rich agricultural and pastoral
region. Yaritagua (pop. about 12,000), 20 m. E. of Barquisimeto,
and 1026 ft. above the sea, is known for its cigar manufactories.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LARAISH<a name="ar159" id="ar159"></a></span> (<i>El Araish</i>), a port in northern Morocco on the
Atlantic coast in 35° 13&prime; N., 6° 9&prime; W., 43 m. by sea S. by W. of
Tangier, picturesquely situated on the left bank of the estuary
of the Wad Lekkus. Pop. 6000 to 7000. The river, being fairly
deep inside the bar, made this a favourite port for the Salli
rovers to winter in, but the quantity of alluvial soil brought
down threatens to close the port. The town is well situated
for defence, its walls are in fair condition, and it has ten forts,
all supplied with old-fashioned guns. Traces of the Spanish
occupation from 1610-1689 are to be seen in the towers whose
names are given by Tissot as those of St Stephen, St James and
that of the Jews, with the Castle of Our Lady of Europe, now the
kasbah or citadel. The most remarkable feature of Laraish is
its fine large market-place inside the town with a low colonnade
in front of very small shops. The streets, though narrow and
steep, are generally paved. Its chief exports are oranges, millet,
dra and other cereals, goat-hair and skins, sheepskins, wool and
fullers&rsquo; earth. The wool goes chiefly to Marseilles. The annual
value of the trade is from £400,000 to £500,000.</p>

<p>In 1780 all the Europeans in Laraish were expelled by
Mohammed XVI., although in 1786 the monopoly of its trade
had been granted to Holland, even its export of wheat. In
1787 the Moors were still building pirate vessels here, the timber
for which came from the neighbouring forest of M&rsquo;amora. Not
far from the town are the remains of what is believed to be a
Phoenician city, Shammish, mentioned by Idrisi, who makes
no allusion to Laraish. It is not, however, improbable from a
passage in Scylax that the site of the present town was occupied
by a Libyan settlement. Tradition also connects Laraish with
the garden of the Hesperides, &lsquo;<i>Ar&#257;si</i> being the Arabic for
&ldquo;pleasure-gardens,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;golden apples&rdquo; perhaps the
familiar oranges.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LARAMIE,<a name="ar160" id="ar160"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of Albany county,
Wyoming, U.S.A., on the Laramie river, 57 m. by rail N.W. of
Cheyenne. Pop. (1900) 8207, of whom 1280 were foreign-born;
(1905) 7601; (1910) 8237. It is served by the Union Pacific
and the Laramie, Hahn&rsquo;s Peak &amp; Pacific railways, the latter
extending from Laramie to Centennial (30 m.). The city is
situated on the Laramie Plains, at an elevation of 7165 ft.,
and is hemmed in on three sides by picturesque mountains.
It has a public library, a United States Government building
and hospitals, and is the seat of the university of Wyoming
and of a Protestant Episcopal missionary bishopric. There is a
state fish hatchery in the vicinity. The university (part of the
public school system of the state) was founded in 1886, was
opened in 1887, and embraces a College of Liberal Arts and
Graduate School, a Normal School, a College of Agriculture and
the Mechanic Arts, an Agricultural Experiment Station (established
by a Federal appropriation), a College of Engineering, a
School of Music, a Preparatory School and a Summer School.
Laramie is a supply and distributing centre for a live-stock
raising and mining region&mdash;particularly coal mining, though
gold, silver, copper and iron are also found. The Union Pacific
Railroad Company has machine shops, repair shops and rolling
mills at Laramie, and, a short distance S. of the city, ice-houses
and a tie-preserving plant. The manufactures include glass,
leather, flour, plaster and pressed brick, the brick being made
from shale obtained in the vicinity. The municipality owns
and operates the water-works; the water is obtained from large
springs about 2½ m. distant. Laramie was settled in 1868,
by people largely from New England, Michigan, Wisconsin and
Iowa, and was named in honour of Jacques Laramie, a French
fur trader. It was first chartered as a city in 1868 by the legislature
of Dakota, and was rechartered by the legislature of
Wyoming in 1873.</p>

Coal-mining is the chief industry. The principal buildings are
the church, finely placed overlooking the river, the Stirling
district asylum and the Scottish National Institution for imbecile
children. In the churchyard is a monument to James Bruce,
the Abyssinian traveller, who was born and died at Kinnaird
House, 2½ m. N.E. Two m. N. by W. are the ruins of Torwood

<p><span class="bold">LARCENY<a name="ar162" id="ar162"></a></span> (an adaptation of Fr. <i>larcin</i>, O. Fr. <i>larrecin</i>, from
Lat. <i>latrocinium</i>, theft, <i>latio</i>, robber), the unlawful taking and
carrying away of things personal, with intent to deprive the
rightful owner of the same. The term <i>theft</i>, sometimes used as a
synonym of larceny, is in reality a broader term, applying to all
cases of depriving another of his property whether by removing
or withholding it, and includes larceny, robbery, cheating,
embezzlement, breach of trust, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Larceny is, in modern legal systems, universally treated as a
crime, but the conception of it as a crime is not one belonging to
the earliest stage of law. To its latest period Roman law regarded
larceny or theft (<i>furtum</i>) as a delict <i>prima facie</i> pursued by a civil
remedy&mdash;the <i>actio furti</i> for a penalty, the <i>vindicatio</i> or <i>condictio</i>
for the stolen property itself or its value. In later times, a
criminal remedy to meet the graver crimes gradually grew up
by the side of the civil, and in the time of Justinian the criminal
remedy, where it existed, took precedence of the civil (<i>Cod.</i>
iii. 8. 4). But to the last criminal proceedings could only be
taken in serious cases, <i>e.g.</i> against stealers of cattle (<i>abigei</i>) or
the clothes of bathers (<i>balnearii</i>). The punishment was death,
banishment, or labour in the mines or on public works. In the
main the Roman law coincides with the English law. The
definition as given in the <i>Institutes</i> (iv. 1. 1) is &ldquo;furtum est
contrectatio rei fraudulosa, vel ipsius rei, vel etiam ejus usus
possessionisve,&rdquo; to which the <i>Digest</i> (xlvii. 2. 1, 3) adds &ldquo;lucri
faciendi gratia.&rdquo; The earliest English definition, that of Bracton
(150<i>b</i>), runs thus: &ldquo;furtum est secundum leges contrectatio
rei alienae fraudulenta cum animo furandi invito illo domino
cujus res illa fuerit.&rdquo; Bracton omits the &ldquo;lucri faciendi gratia&rdquo;
of the Roman definition, because in English law the motive
is immaterial,<a name="fa1l" id="fa1l" href="#ft1l"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and the &ldquo;usus ejus possessionisve,&rdquo; because the
definition includes an intent to deprive the owner of his property
permanently. The &ldquo;animo furandi&rdquo; and &ldquo;invito domino&rdquo; of
Bracton&rsquo;s definition are expansions for the sake of greater clearness.
They seem to have been implied in Roman law. <i>Furtum</i>
is on the whole a more comprehensive term than larceny. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>210</span>
difference no doubt arises from the tendency to extend the bounds
of a delict and to limit the bounds of a crime. Thus it was
<i>furtum</i> (but it would not be theft at English common law) to use
a deposit of pledge contrary to the wishes of the owner, to retain
goods found, or to steal a human being, such as a slave or <i>filius
familias</i> (a special form of <i>furtum</i> called <i>plagium</i>). The latter
would be in English law an abduction under certain circumstances
but not a theft. One of two married persons could not commit
<i>furtum</i> as against the other, but larceny may be so committed
in England since the Married Women&rsquo;s Property Act 1882.
As a <i>furtum</i> was merely a delict, the <i>obligatio ex delicto</i> could be
extinguished by agreement between the parties; this cannot
be done in England. In another direction English law is more
considerate of the rights of third parties than was Roman.
The thief can give a good title to stolen goods; in Roman law
he could not do so, except in the single case of a <i>hereditas</i> acquired
by <i>usucapio</i>. The development of the law of <i>furtum</i> at Rome
is historically interesting, for even in its latest period is found a
relic of one of the most primitive theories of law adopted by
courts of justice: &ldquo;They took as their guide the measure of
vengeance likely to be exacted by an aggrieved person under
the circumstances of the case&rdquo; (Maine, <i>Ancient Law</i>, ch. x.).
This explains the reason of the division of <i>furtum</i> into <i>manifestum</i>
and <i>nec manifestum</i>. The manifest thief was one taken
red-handed&mdash;&ldquo;taken with the manner,&rdquo; in the language of old
English law. The Twelve Tables denounced the punishment of
death against the manifest thief, for that would be the penalty
demanded by the indignant owner in whose place the judge stood.
The severity of this penalty was afterwards mitigated by the
praetor, who substituted for it the payment of quadruple the
value of the thing stolen. The same penalty was also given by
the praetor in case of theft from a fire or a wreck, or of prevention
of search. The Twelve Tables mulcted the non-manifest thief in
double the value of the thing stolen. The actions for penalties
were in addition to the action for the stolen goods themselves or
their value. The quadruple and double penalties still remain
in the legislation of Justinian. The search for stolen goods, as it
existed in the time of Gaius, was a survival of a period when the
injured person was, as in the case of summons (<i>in jus vocatio</i>),
his own executive officer. Such a search, by the Twelve Tables,
might be conducted in the house of the supposed thief by the
owner in person, naked except for a cincture, and carrying a
platter in his hand, safeguards apparently against any possibility
of his making a false charge by depositing some of his own
property on his neighbour&rsquo;s premises. This mode of search
became obsolete before the time of Justinian. Robbery (<i>bona vi
rapta</i>) was violence added to <i>furtum</i>. By the <i>actio vi bonorum
raptorum</i> quadruple the value could be recovered if the action
were brought within a year, only the value if brought after the
expiration of a year. The quadruple value included the stolen
thing itself, so that the penalty was in effect only a triple one.
It was inclusive, and not cumulative, as in <i>furtum</i>.</p>

<p>In England theft or larceny appears to have been very early
regarded by legislators as a matter calling for special attention.
The pre-Conquest compilations of laws are full of provisions on
the subject. The earlier laws appear to regard it as a delict
which may be compounded for by payment. Considerable
distinctions of person are made, both in regard to the owner
and the thief. Thus, by the laws of Æthelberht, if a freeman
stole from the king he was to restore ninefold, if from a freeman
or from a dwelling, threefold. If a theow stole, he had only to
make a twofold reparation. In the laws of Alfred ordinary
theft was still only civil, but he who stole in a church was
punished by the loss of his hand. The laws of Ina named as
the penalty death or redemption according to the wer-gild of
the thief. By the same laws the thief might be slain if he fled
or resisted. Gradually the severity of the punishment increased.
By the laws of Æthelstan death in a very cruel form was inflicted.
At a later date the <i>Leges Henrici Primi</i> placed a thief in the
king&rsquo;s mercy, and his lands were forfeited. Putting out the
eyes and other kinds of mutilation were sometimes the punishment.
The principle of severity continued down to the 19th
century, and until 1827 theft or larceny of certain kinds remained
capital. Both before and after the Conquest local
jurisdiction over thieves was a common franchise of lords of
manors, attended with some of the advantages of modern
summary jurisdiction.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Under the common law larceny was a felony. It was affected by
numerous statutes, the main object of legislation being to bring
within the law of larceny offences which were not larcenies at common
law, either because they were thefts of things of which there could
be no larceny at common law, <i>e.g.</i> beasts <i>ferae naturae</i>, title deeds
or choses in action, or because the common law regarded them merely
as delicts for which the remedy was by civil action, <i>e.g.</i> fraudulent
breaches of trust. The earliest act in the statutes of the realm
dealing with larceny appears to be the <i>Carta Forestae</i> of 1225, by
which fine or imprisonment was inflicted for stealing the king&rsquo;s
deer. The next act appears to be the statute of Westminster the
First (1275), dealing again with stealing deer. It seems as though
the beginning of legislation on the subject was for the purpose of
protecting the chases and parks of the king and the nobility. A
very large number of the old acts are named in the repealing act of
1827. An act of the same date removed the old distinction between
grand and petit larceny.<a name="fa2l" id="fa2l" href="#ft2l"><span class="sp">2</span></a> The former was theft of goods above the
value of twelve pence, in the house of the owner, not from the
person, or by night, and was a capital crime. It was petit larceny
where the value was twelve pence or under, the punishment being
imprisonment or whipping. The gradual depreciation in the value
of money afforded good ground for Sir Henry Spelman&rsquo;s sarcasm
that, while everything else became dearer, the life of man became
continually cheaper. The distinction between grand and petit
larceny first appears in statute law in the Statute of Westminster
the First, c. 15, but it was not created for the first time by that
statute. It is found in some of the pre-Conquest codes, as that of
Æthelstan, and it is recognized in the <i>Leges Henrici Primi</i>. A
distinction between simple and compound larceny is still found in
the books. The latter is larceny accompanied by circumstances of
aggravation, as that it is in a dwelling-house or from the person.
The law of larceny is now contained chiefly in the Larceny Act 1861
(which extends to England and Ireland), a comprehensive enactment
including larceny, embezzlement, fraud by bailees, agents, bankers,
factors, and trustees, sacrilege, burglary, housebreaking, robbery,
obtaining money by threats or by false pretences, and receiving
stolen goods, and prescribing procedure, both civil and criminal.
There are, however, other acts in force dealing with special cases of
larceny, such as an act of Henry VIII. as to stealing the goods of
the king, and the Game, Post-Office and Merchant Shipping Acts.
There are separate acts providing for larceny by a partner of partnership
property, and by a husband or wife of the property of the other
(Married Women&rsquo;s Property Act 1882). Proceedings against persons
subject to naval or military law depend upon the Naval Discipline
Act 1866 and the Army Act 1881. There are several acts, both
before and after 1861, directing how the property is to be laid in
indictments for stealing the goods of counties, friendly societies,
trades unions, &amp;c. The principal conditions which must exist in
order to constitute larceny are these: (1) there must be an actual
taking into the possession of the thief, though the smallest removal
is sufficient; (2) there must be an intent to deprive the owner of
his property for an indefinite period, and to assume the entire
dominion over it, an intent often described in Bracton&rsquo;s words as
<i>animus furandi</i>; (3) this intent must exist at the time of taking;
(4) the thing taken must be one capable of larceny either at common
law or by statute. One or two cases falling under the law of larceny
are of special interest. It was held more than once that a servant
taking corn to feed his master&rsquo;s horses, but without any intention of
applying it for his own benefit, was guilty of larceny. To remedy
this hardship, the Misappropriation of Servants Act 1863 was
passed to declare such an act not to be felony. The case of appropriation
of goods which have been found has led to some difficulty.
It now seems to be the law that in order to constitute a larceny of
lost goods there must be a felonious intent at the time of finding,
that is, an intent to deprive the owner of them, coupled with reasonable
means at the same time of knowing the owner. The mere
retention of the goods when the owner has become known to the
finder does not make the retention criminal. Larceny of money
may be committed when the money is paid by mistake, if the
prisoner took it <i>animo furandi</i>. In two noteworthy cases the
question was argued before a very full court for crown cases reserved,
and in each case there was a striking difference of opinion.
In <i>R.</i> v. <i>Middleton</i>, 1873, L.R. 2 C.C.R., 38, the prisoner, a depositor
in a post-office savings bank, received by the mistake of the
clerk a larger sum that he was entitled to. The jury found that
he had the <i>animus furandi</i> at the time of taking the money, and
that he knew it to be the money of the postmaster-general. The
majority of the court held it to be larceny. In a case in 1885 (<i>R.</i> v.
<i>Ashwell</i>, L.R. 16 Q.B.D. 190), where the prosecutor gave the
prisoner a sovereign believing it to be a shilling, and the prisoner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>211</span>
took it under that belief, but afterwards discovered its value and
retained it, the court was equally divided as to whether the prisoner
was guilty of larceny at common law, but held that he was not
guilty of larceny as a bailee. Legislation has considerably affected
the procedure in prosecutions for larceny. The inconveniences of
the common law rules of interpretation of indictments led to certain
amendments of the law, now contained in the Larceny Act, for
the purpose of avoiding the frequent failures of justice owing to the
strictness with which indictments were construed. Three larcenies
of property of the same person within six months may now be
charged in one indictment. On an indictment for larceny the prisoner
may be found guilty of embezzlement, and <i>vice versa</i>; and if the
prisoner be indicted for obtaining goods by false pretences, and the
offence turn out to be larceny, he is not entitled to be acquitted of
the misdemeanour. A count for receiving may be joined with the
count for stealing. In many cases it is unnecessary to allege or
prove ownership of the property the subject of the indictment.
The act also contains numerous provisions as to venue and the
apprehension of offenders. In another direction the powers of
courts of Summary Jurisdiction (<i>q.v.</i>) have been extended, in the
case of charges of larceny, embezzlement and receiving stolen
goods, against children and young persons and against adults pleading
guilty or waiving their right to trial by jury. The maximum
punishment for larceny is fourteen years&rsquo; penal servitude, but this
can only be inflicted in certain exceptional cases, such as horse or
cattle stealing and larceny by a servant or a person in the service
of the crown or the police. The extreme punishment for simple
larceny after a previous conviction for felony is ten years&rsquo; penal
servitude. Whipping may be part of the sentence on boys under
sixteen.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Scotland.</i>&mdash;A vast number of acts of the Scottish parliament
dealt with larceny. The general policy of the acts was to make
larceny what was not larceny at common law, <i>e.g.</i> stealing fruit,
dogs, hawks or deer, and to extend the remedies, <i>e.g.</i> by giving
the justiciar authority throughout the kingdom, by making
the master in the case of theft by the servant liable to give the
latter up to justice, or by allowing the use of firearms against
thieves. The general result of legislation in England and
Scotland has been to assimilate the law of larceny in both
kingdoms. As a rule, what would be larceny in one would be
larceny in the other.</p>

<p><i>United Stales.</i>&mdash;The law depends almost entirely upon state
legislation, and is in general accordance with that of England.
The only acts of Congress bearing on the subject deal with
larceny in the army and navy, and with larceny and receiving
on the high seas or in any place under the exclusive jurisdiction
of the United States, <i>e.g.</i> Alaska.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Alaska.</i>&mdash;Stealing any goods, chattels, government note, bank
note, or other thing in action, books of account, &amp;c., is larceny:
punishment, imprisonment for not less than one nor more than ten
years if the property stolen is in value over $35. Larceny in any
dwelling-house, warehouse, steamship, church, &amp;c., is punishable
by imprisonment for not less than one nor more than seven years.
Larceny of a horse, mule, ass, bull, steer, cow or reindeer is punishable
by imprisonment for not less than one nor more than fifteen
years. Wilfully altering or defacing marks or brands on such animals
is larceny (Pen. Code Alaska, § 45, 1899).</p>

<p><i>Arizona.</i>&mdash;Appropriating property found without due inquiry
for the owner is larceny (Penal Code, § 442). &ldquo;Dogs are property
and of the value of <i>one dollar each</i> within the meaning of the terms
&lsquo;property&rsquo; and &lsquo;value&rsquo; as used in this chapter&rdquo; (<i>id.</i> § 448). Property
includes a passage ticket though never issued. Persons stealing
property in another state or county, or who receive it knowing it to
be stolen and bring it into Arizona, may be convicted and punished
as if the offence was committed there (<i>id.</i> § 454). Stealing gas or
water from a main is a misdemeanour.</p>

<p><i>Iowa.</i>&mdash;It is larceny to steal electricity, gas or water from wires,
meters or mains (L. 1903, ch. 132).</p>

<p><i>New York.</i>&mdash;Larceny as defined by § 528 of the Penal Code includes
also embezzlement, obtaining property by false pretences,
and felonious breach of trust (<i>People</i> v. <i>Dumar</i>, 106 N.Y. 508), but
the method of proof required to establish these offences has not been
changed. Grand larceny in the <i>first degree</i> is (<i>a</i>) stealing property
of any value in the night time; (<i>b</i>) of $25 in value or more at night
from a dwelling house, vessel or railway car; (<i>c</i>) of the value of
more than $500 in any manner; in the <i>second degree</i> (<i>a</i>) stealing in
any manner property of the value of over $25 and under $500;
(<i>b</i>) taking from the person property of any value; (<i>c</i>) stealing any
record of a court or other record filed with any public officer. Every
other larceny is petit larceny. &ldquo;Value&rdquo; of any stock, bond or
security having a market value is the amount of money due thereon
or what, in any contingency, might be collected thereon; of any
passenger ticket the price it is usually sold at. The value of anything
else not fixed by statute is its market value. Grand larceny,
in the first degree, is punishable by imprisonment not exceeding ten
years; in the second degree, not exceeding five years. Petit larceny
is a misdemeanour (Penal Code, §§ 530-535). Bringing stolen goods
into the state knowing them to be stolen is punishable as larceny
within the state (<i>id.</i> § 540). A &ldquo;pay ticket&rdquo; for removing a load
of snow may be the subject of larceny and its value the amount to
be paid on it. (<i>People</i> v. <i>Fletcher</i> [1906] 110 App. D. 231).</p>

<p><i>Kansas.</i>&mdash;The owner of goods who takes them from a railroad
company with intent to defeat its lien for transportation charges is
guilty of larceny. (<i>Atchison Co.</i> v. <i>Hinsdell</i> [1907] 90 Pac. Rep. 800).</p>

<p><i>Massachusetts.</i>&mdash;Larceny includes embezzlement and obtaining
money by false pretences. (Rev. L. 1902, ch. 218, § 40.) The failing
to restore to or to notify the owner of property removed from
premises on fire is larceny (<i>id.</i> ch. 208, § 22). It is larceny to purchase
property (payment for which is to be made on or before delivery)
by means of a false pretence as to means or ability to pay, provided
such pretence is signed by the person to be charged. Indictment for
stealing a will need not contain an allegation of value (<i>id.</i> § 29).
A person convicted either as accessory or principal of three distinct
larcenies shall be adjudged &ldquo;a common and notorious thief&rdquo; and
may be imprisoned for not more than twenty years (<i>id.</i> 31). On
second conviction for larceny of a bicycle, the thief may be imprisoned
for not more than five years. Larceny of things annexed
to realty is punishable as if it were a larceny of personal property
(<i>id.</i> §§ 33, 35).</p>

<p><i>Ohio.</i>&mdash;Stealing &ldquo;anything of value&rdquo; is larceny (Bates Stats.
§ 6856). Tapping gas pipes is punishable by fine or imprisonment
for not more than thirty days. Stealing timber having &ldquo;timber
dealers&rsquo;&rdquo; trade mark, or removing it from a stream, is punishable
by a fine of not less than $20.</p>

<p><i>Utah.</i>&mdash;It is grand larceny to alter the mark or brand on an
animal (L. 1905, ch. 38).</p>

<p><i>Wyoming.</i>&mdash;For branding or altering or defacing the brand on
cattle with intent to steal, the penalty is imprisonment for not
more than five years. It is larceny for a bailee to convert with
intent to steal goods left with or found by him (Rev. Stats. §§ 4986,
4989).</p>

<p><i>Washington.</i>&mdash;A horse not branded, but under Code § 6861 an
&ldquo;outlaw,&rdquo; the owner being unknown, can be the subject of a larceny,
having been held to be property of the state. (<i>State</i> v. <i>Eddy</i> [1907],
90 Pac. Rep. 641). For the third offence of such a larceny the penalty
is imprisonment for <i>life</i> (L. 1903, ch. 86).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LARCH<a name="ar163" id="ar163"></a></span> (from the Ger. <i>Lärche</i>, M.H.G. <i>Lerche</i>, Lat. <i>larix</i>),
a name applied to a small group of coniferous trees, of which
the common larch of Europe is taken as the type. The
members of the genus <i>Larix</i> are distinguished from the firs,
with which they were formerly placed, by their deciduous leaves,
scattered singly, as in <i>Abies</i>, on the young shoots of the season,
but on all older branchlets growing in whorl-like tufts, each
surrounding the extremity of a rudimentary or abortive branch;
they differ from cedars (<i>Cedrus</i>), which also have the fascicles
of leaves on arrested branchlets, not only in the deciduous leaves,
but in the cones, the scales of which are thinner towards the apex,
and are persistent, remaining attached long after the seeds are
discharged. The trees of the genus are closely allied in botanic
features, as well as in general appearance, so that it is sometimes
difficult to assign to them determinate specific characters, and
the limit between species and variety is not always very accurately
defined. Nearly all are natives of Europe, or the northern
plains and mountain ranges of Asia and North America, though
one (<i>Larix Griffithii</i>) occurs only on the Himalayas.</p>

<p>The common larch (<i>L. europaea</i>) is, when grown in perfection,
a stately tree with tall erect trunk, gradually tapering from
root to summit, and horizontal branches springing at irregular
intervals from the stem, and in old trees often becoming more
or less drooping, but rising again towards the extremities;
the branchlets or side shoots, very slender and pendulous, are
pretty thickly studded with the spurs each bearing a fascicle
of thirty or more narrow linear leaves, of a peculiar bright light
green when they first appear in the spring, but becoming of a
deeper hue when mature. The yellow stamen-bearing flowers
are in sessile, nearly spherical catkins; the fertile ones vary in
colour, from red or purple to greenish-white, in different varieties;
the erect cones, which remain long on the branches, are above
an inch in length and oblong-ovate in shape, with reddish-brown
scales somewhat waved on the edges, the lower bracts usually
rather longer than the scales. The tree flowers in April or May,
and the winged seeds are shed the following autumn. When
standing in an open space, the larch grows of a nearly conical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>212</span>
shape, with the lower branches almost reaching the ground,
while those above gradually diminish in length towards the top
of the trunk, presenting a very symmetrical form; but in dense
woods the lower parts become bare of foliage, as with the firs
under similar circumstances. When springing up among rocks
or on ledges, the stem sometimes becomes much curved, and,
with its spreading boughs and pendent branchlets, often forms
a striking and picturesque object in alpine passes and steep
ravines. In the prevalent European varieties the bark is
reddish-grey, and rather rough and scarred in old trees, which
are often much lichen-covered. The trunk attains a height of
from 80 to 140 ft., with a diameter of from 3 to 5 ft. near the
ground, but in close woods is comparatively slender in proportion
to its altitude. The larch abounds on the Alps of Switzerland,
on which it flourishes at an elevation of 5000 ft., and also on
those of Tirol and Savoy, on the Carpathians, and in most of the
hill regions of central Europe; it is not wild on the Apennine
chain, or the Pyrenees, and in the wild state is unknown in the
Spanish peninsula. It forms extensive woods in Russia, but
does not extend to Scandinavia, where its absence is somewhat
remarkable, as the tree grows freely in Norway and Sweden
where planted, and even multiplies itself by self-sown seed,
according to F. C. Schübeler, in the neighbourhood of Trondhjem.
In the north-eastern parts of Russia, in the country towards
the Petchora river, and on the Ural, a peculiar variety prevails,
regarded by some as a distinct species (<i>L. sibirica</i>); this form is
abundant nearly throughout Siberia, extending to the Pacific
coast of Kamchatka and the hills of the Amur region. The
Siberian larch has smooth grey bark and smaller cones, approaching
in shape somewhat to those of the American hackmatack;
it seems even hardier than the Alpine tree, growing up to latitude
68°, but, as the inclement climate of the polar shores is neared,
dwindling down to a dwarf and even trailing bush.</p>

<p>The larch, from its lofty straight trunk and the high quality
of its wood, is one of the most important of coniferous trees;
its growth is extremely rapid, the stem attaining a large size
in from sixty to eighty years, while the tree yields good useful
timber at forty or fifty; it forms firm heartwood at an early
age, and the sapwood is less perishable than that of the firs,
rendering it more valuable in the young state.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The wood of large trees is compact in texture, in the best varieties
of a deep reddish colour varying to brownish-yellow, but apt to be
lighter in tint, and less hard in grain, when grown in rich soils or
in low sheltered situations. It is remarkably tough, resisting a
rending strain better than any of the fir or pine woods in common
use, though not as elastic as some; properly seasoned, it is as little
liable to shrink as to split; the boughs being small compared to
the trunk, the timber is more free from large knots, and the small
knots remain firm and undecayed. The only drawback to these
good qualities is a certain liability to warp and bend, unless very
carefully seasoned; for this purpose it is recommended to be left
floating in water for a year after felling, and then allowed some
months to dry slowly and completely before sawing up the logs;
barking the trunk in winter while the tree is standing, and leaving
it in that state till the next year, has been often advised with the
larch as with other timber, but the practical inconveniences of the
plan have prevented its adoption on any large scale. When well
prepared for use, larch is one of the most durable of coniferous
woods. Its strength and toughness render it valuable for naval
purposes, to which it is largely applied; its freedom from any
tendency to split adapts it for clinker-built boats. It is much employed
for house-building; most of the picturesque log-houses in
Vaud and the adjacent cantons are built of squared larch trunks,
and derive their fine brown tint from the hardened resin that slowly
exudes from the wood after long exposure to the summer sun; the
wooden shingles, that in Switzerland supply the place of tiles, are
also frequently of larch. In Germany it is much used by the cooper
as well as the carpenter, while the form of the trunk admirably
adapts it for all purposes for which long straight timber is needed.
It answers well for fence-posts and river piles; many of the foundations
of Venice rest upon larch, the lasting qualities of which were
well known and appreciated, not only in medieval times, but in the
days of Vitruvius and Pliny. The harder and darker varieties are
used in the construction of cheap solid furniture, being fine in grain
and taking polish better than many more costly woods. A peculiarity
of larch wood is the difficulty with which it is ignited, although so
resinous; and, coated with a thin layer of plaster, beams and
pillars of larch might probably be found to justify Caesar&rsquo;s epithet
&ldquo;igni impenetrabile lignum&rdquo;; even the small branches are not
easily kept alight, and a larch fire in the open needs considerable
care. Yet the forests of larch in Siberia often suffer from conflagration.
When these fires occur while the trees are full of sap,
a curious mucilaginous matter is exuded from the half-burnt stems;
when dry it is of pale reddish colour, like some of the coarser kinds
of gum-arabic, and is soluble in water, the solution resembling gum-water,
in place of which it is sometimes used; considerable quantities
are collected and sold as &ldquo;Orenburg gum&rdquo;; in Siberia and Russia
it is occasionally employed as a semi-medicinal food, being esteemed
an antiscorbutic. For burning in close stoves and furnaces, larch
makes tolerably good fuel, its value being estimated by Hartig as
only one-fifth less than that of beech; the charcoal is compact,
and is in demand for iron-smelting and other metallurgic uses in
some parts of Europe.</p>

<p>In the trunk of the larch, especially when growing in climates
where the sun is powerful in summer, a fine clear turpentine exists
in great abundance; in Savoy and the south of Switzerland, it is
collected for sale, though not in such quantity as formerly, when,
being taken to Venice for shipment, it was known in commerce as
&ldquo;Venice turpentine.&rdquo; Old trees are selected, from the bark of
which it is observed to ooze in the early summer; holes are bored
in the trunk, somewhat inclined upward towards the centre of the
stem, in which, between the layers of wood, the turpentine is said
to collect in small lacunae; wooden gutters placed in these holes
convey the viscous fluid into little wooden pails hung on the end of
each gutter; the secretion flows slowly all through the summer
months, and a tree in proper condition yields from 6 to 8 &#8468; a year,
and will continue to give an annual supply for thirty or forty years,
being, however, rendered quite useless for timber by subjection to
this process. In Tirol, a single hole is made near the root of the
tree in the spring; this is stopped with a plug, and the turpentine
is removed by a scoop in the autumn; but each tree yields only
from a few ounces to ½ &#8468; by this process. Real larch turpentine is
a thick tenacious fluid, of a deep yellow colour, and nearly transparent;
it does not harden by time; it contains 15% of the essential
oil of turpentine, also resin, succinic, pinic and sylvic acids, and a
bitter extractive matter. According to Pereira, much sold under
the name of Venice turpentine is a mixture of common resin and
oil of turpentine. On the French Alps a sweet exudation is found
on the small branchlets of young larches in June and July, resembling
manna in taste and laxative properties, and known as <i>Manna de
Briançon</i> or <i>Manna Brigantina</i>; it occurs in small whitish irregular
granular masses, which are removed in the morning before they are
too much dried by the sun; this manna seems to differ little in
composition from the sap of the tree, which also contains <i>mannite</i>;
its cathartic powers are weaker than those of the manna of the
manna ash (<i>Fraximus ornus</i>), but it is employed in France for the
same purposes.</p>

<p>The bark of the larch is largely used in some countries for tanning;
it is taken from the trunk only, being stripped from the trees when
felled; its value is about equal to that of birch bark; but, according
to the experience of British tanners, it is scarcely half as strong as
that of the oak. The soft inner bark is occasionally used in Siberia
as a ferment, by hunters and others, being boiled and mixed with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>213</span>
rye-meal, and buried in the snow for a short time, when it is employed
as a substitute for other leaven, and in making the sour
liquor called &ldquo;quass.&rdquo; In Germany a fungus (<i>Polyporus Laricis</i>)
grows on the roots and stems of decaying larches, which was formerly
in esteem as a drastic purgative. The young shoots of the larch are
sometimes given in Switzerland as fodder to cattle.</p>
</div>

<p>The larch, though mentioned by Parkinson in 1629 as &ldquo;nursed
up&rdquo; by a few &ldquo;lovers of variety&rdquo; as a rare exotic, does not seem
to have been much grown in England till early in the 18th century.
In Scotland the date of its introduction is a disputed point,
but it seems to have been planted at Dunkeld by the 2nd duke
of Athole in 1727, and about thirteen or fourteen years later
considerable plantations were made at that place, the commencement
of one of the largest planting experiments on record; it is
estimated that 14 million larches were planted on the Athole
estates between that date and 1826. The cultivation of the tree
rapidly spread, and the larch has become a conspicuous feature
of the scenery in many parts of Scotland. It grows as rapidly
and attains as large a size in British habitats suited to it as in
its home on the Alps, and often produces equally good timber.
The larch of Europe is essentially a mountain tree, and requires
not only free air above, but a certain moderate amount of
moisture in the soil beneath, with, at the same time, perfect
drainage, to bring the timber to perfection. Where there is
complete freedom from stagnant water in the ground, and
abundant room for the spread of its branches to light and air,
the larch will flourish in a great variety of soils, stiff clays, wet
or mossy peat, and moist alluvium being the chief exceptions;
in its native localities it seems partial to the debris of primitive
and metamorphic rocks, but is occasionally found growing
luxuriantly on calcareous subsoils; in Switzerland it attains
the largest size, and forms the best timber, on the northern
declivities of the mountains; but in Scotland a southern aspect
appears most favourable.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The best variety for culture in Britain is that with red female
flowers; the light-flowered kinds are said to produce inferior wood,
and the Siberian larch does not grow in Scotland nearly as fast as
the Alpine tree. The larch is raised from seed in immense numbers
in British nurseries; that obtained from Germany is preferred,
being more perfectly ripened than the cones of home growth usually
are. The seeds are sown in April, on rich ground, which should not
be too highly manured; the young larches are planted out when
two years old, or sometimes transferred to a nursery bed to attain
a larger size; but, like all conifers, they succeed best when planted
young; on the mountains, the seedlings are usually put into a mere
slit made in the ground by a spade with a triangular blade, the place
being first cleared of any heath, bracken, or tall herbage that might
smother the young tree; the plants should be from 3 to 4 ft. apart,
or even more, according to the growth intended before thinning,
which should be begun as soon as the boughs begin to overspread
much; little or no pruning is needed beyond the careful removal
of dead branches. The larch is said not to succeed on arable land,
especially where corn has been grown, but experience does not
seem to support this view; that against the previous occupation
of the ground by Scotch fir or Norway spruce is probably better
founded, and, where timber is the object, it should not be planted
with other conifers. On the Grampians and neighbouring hills the
larch will flourish at a greater elevation than the pine, and will
grow up to an altitude of 1700 or even 1800 ft.; but it attains its
full size on lower slopes. In very dry and bleak localities, the Scotch
fir will probably be more successful up to 900 ft. above the sea, the
limit of the luxuriant growth of that hardy conifer in Britain; and
in moist valleys or on imperfectly drained acclivities Norway
spruce is more suitable. The growth of the larch while young is
exceedingly rapid; in the south of England it will often attain a
height of 25 ft. in the first ten years, while in favourable localities
it will grow upwards of 80 ft. in half a century or less; one at
Dunkeld felled sixty years after planting was 110 ft. high; but
usually the tree does not increase so rapidly after the first thirty
of forty years. Some larches in Scotland rival in size the most
gigantic specimens standing in their native woods; a tree at Dalwick,
Peeblesshire, attained 5 ft. in diameter; one at Glenarbuck, near
the Clyde, grew above 140 ft. high, with a circumference of 13 ft.
The annual increase in girth is often considerable even in large trees;
the fine larch near the abbey of Dunkeld figured by Strutt in his
<i>Sylva Britannica</i> increased 2½ ft. between 1796 and 1825, its measurement
at the latter date being 13 ft., with a height of 97½ ft.</p>

<p>In the south of England, the larch is much planted for the supply
of hop-poles, though in parts of Kent and Sussex poles formed of
Spanish chestnut are regarded as still more lasting. In plantations
made with this object, the seedlings are placed very close (from 1½
to 2 ft. apart), and either cut down all at once, when the required
height is attained or thinned out, leaving the remainder to gain a
greater length; the land is always well trenched before planting.
The best month for larch planting, whether for poles or timber, is
November; larches are sometimes planted in the spring, but the
practice cannot be commended, as the sap flows early, and, if a dry
period follows, the growth is sure to be checked. The thinnings of
the larch woods in the Highlands are in demand for railway sleepers,
scaffold poles, and mining timber, and are applied to a variety of
agricultural purposes. The tree generally succeeds on the Welsh
hills.</p>

<p>The young seedlings are sometimes nibbled by the hare and
rabbit; and on parts of the highland hills both bark and shoots
are eaten in the winter by the roe-deer; larch woods should always
be fenced in to keep out the hill-cattle, which will browse upon
the shoots in spring. The &ldquo;woolly aphis,&rdquo; &ldquo;American blight,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;larch blight&rdquo; (<i>Eriosoma laricis</i>) often attacks the trees in close
valleys, but rarely spreads much unless other unhealthy conditions
are present. The larch suffers from several diseases caused by
fungi; the most important is the larch-canker caused by the parasitism
of <i>Peziza Willkommii</i>. The spores germinate on a damp surface
and enter the cortex through small cracks or wounds in the protecting
layer. The fungus-mycelium will go on growing indefinitely in the
cambium layer, thus killing and destroying a larger area year by year.
The most effective method of treatment is to cut out the diseased
branch or patch as early as possible. Another disease which is
sometimes confused with that caused by the <i>Peziza</i> is &ldquo;heart-rot&rdquo;;
it occasionally attacks larches only ten years old or less, but is more
common when the trees have acquired a considerable size, sometimes
spreading in a short time through a whole plantation. The trees for
a considerable period show little sign of unhealthiness, but eventually
the stem begins to swell somewhat near the root, and the whole tree
gradually goes off as the disease advances; when cut down, the
trunk is found to be decayed at the centre, the &ldquo;rot&rdquo; usually commencing
near the ground. Trees of good size are thus rendered
nearly worthless, often showing little sign of unhealthiness till felled.
Great difference of opinion exists among foresters as to the cause
of this destructive malady; but it is probably the direct result of
unsuitable soil, especially soil containing insufficient nourishment.</p>

<p>Considerable quantities of larch timber are imported into Britain
for use in the dockyards, in addition to the large home supply.
The quality varies much, as well as the colour and density; an
Italian sample in the museum at Kew (of a very dark red tint) weighs
about 24½ &#8468; to the cub. ft., while a Polish specimen, of equally deep
hue, is 44 &#8468; 1 oz. to the same measurement.</p>

<p>For the landscape gardener, the larch is a valuable aid in the
formation of park and pleasure ground; but it is never seen to such
advantage as when hanging over some tumbling burn or rocky
pass among the mountains. A variety with very pendent boughs,
known as the &ldquo;drooping&rdquo; larch var. <i>pendula</i>, is occasionally met
with in gardens.</p>

<p>The bark of the larch has been introduced into pharmacy, being
given, generally in the form of an alcoholic tincture, in chronic
bronchitic affections and internal haemorrhages. It contains, in
addition to tannin, a peculiar principle called <i>larixin</i>, which may be
obtained in a pure state by distillation from a concentrated infusion
of the bark; it is a colourless substance in long crystals, with a
bitter and astringent taste, and a faint acid reaction; hence some
term it <i>larixinic acid</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>The European larch has long been introduced into the United
States, where, in suitable localities, it flourishes as luxuriantly
as in Britain. Plantations have been made in America with an
economic view, the tree growing much faster, and producing
good timber at an earlier age than the native hackmatack
(or tamarack), while the wood is less ponderous, and therefore
more generally applicable.</p>

<p>The genus is represented in the eastern parts of North America
by the hackmatack (<i>L. americana</i>), of which there are several
varieties, two so well marked that they are by some botanists
considered specifically distinct. In one (<i>L. microcarpa</i>) the cones
are very small, rarely exceeding ½ in. in length, of a roundish-oblong
shape; the scales are very few in number, crimson in
the young state, reddish-brown when ripe; the tree much resembles
the European larch in general appearance but is of more
slender growth; its trunk is seldom more than 2 ft. in diameter
and rarely above 80 ft. high; this form is the red larch, the
<i>épinette rouge</i> of the French Canadians. The black larch (<i>L.
pendula</i>) has rather larger cones, of an oblong shape, about ¾ in.
long, purplish or green in the immature state, and dark brown
when ripe, the scales somewhat more numerous, the bracts all
shorter than the scales. The bark is dark bluish-grey, smoother
than in the red larch, on the trunk and lower boughs often
glossy; the branches are more or less pendulous and very
slender.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>214</span></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The red larch grows usually on higher and drier ground, ranging
from the Virginian mountains to the shores of Hudson Bay; the
black larch is found often on moist land, and even in swamps. The
hackmatack is one of the most valuable timber trees of America;
it is in great demand in the ports of the St Lawrence for shipbuilding.
It is far more durable than any of the oaks of that region, is heavy
and close-grained, and much stronger, as well as more lasting, than
that of the pines and firs of Canada. In many parts all the finer trees
have been cut down, but large woods of it still exist in the less accessible
districts; it abounds especially near Lake St John, Quebec, and in
Newfoundland is the prevalent tree in some of the forest tracts;
it is likewise common in Maine and Vermont. In the timber and
building yards the &ldquo;red&rdquo; hackmatack is the kind preferred, the
produce, probably, of <i>L. microcarpa</i>; the &ldquo;grey&rdquo; is less esteemed;
but the varieties from which these woods are obtained cannot
always be traced with certainty. Several fine specimens of the red
larch exist in English parks, but its growth is much slower than that
of <i>L. europaea</i>; the more pendulous forms of <i>L. pendula</i> are elegant
trees for the garden. The hackmatacks might perhaps be grown
with advantage in places too wet for the common larch.</p>

<p>In western America a larch (<i>L. occidentalis</i>) occurs more nearly
resembling <i>L. europaea</i>. The leaves are short, thicker and more rigid
than in any of the other larches; the cones are much larger than those
of the hackmatacks, egg-shaped or oval in outline; the scales are of
a fine red in the immature state, the bracts green and extending far
beyond the scales in a rigid leaf-like point. The bark of the trunk
has the same reddish tint as that of the common larch of Europe.
It is the largest of all larches and one of the most useful timber
trees of North America. Some of the trees are 250 ft. high and 6 to
8 ft. in diameter. The wood is the hardest and strongest of all the
American conifers; it is durable and adapted for construction work
or household furniture.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LARCHER, PIERRE HENRI<a name="ar164" id="ar164"></a></span> (1726-1812), French classical
scholar and archaeologist, was born at Dijon on the 12th of
October 1726. Originally intended for the law, he abandoned
it for the classics. His (anonymous) translation of Chariton&rsquo;s
<i>Chaereas and Callirrhoë</i> (1763) marked him as an excellent
Greek scholar. His attack upon Voltaire&rsquo;s <i>Philosophie de
l&rsquo;historie</i> (published under the name of l&rsquo;Abbé Bazin) created
considerable interest at the time. His archaeological and mythological
<i>Mémoire sur Vénus</i> (1775), which has been ranked
with similar works of Heyne and Winckelmann, gained him
admission to the Académie des Inscriptions (1778). After the
imperial university was founded, he was appointed professor
of Greek literature (1809) with Boissonade as his assistant.
He died on the 22nd of December 1812. Larcher&rsquo;s best work
was his translation of Herodotus (1786, new ed. by L. Humbert,
1880) on the preparation of which he had spent fifteen years.
The translation itself, though correct, is dull, but the commentary
(translated into English, London, 1829, new ed.
1844, by W. D. Cooley) dealing with historical, geographical
and chronological questions, and enriched by a wealth of illustration
from ancient and modern authors, is not without value.</p>

Gr. <span class="grk" title="larinos">&#955;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#962;</span> fat, <span class="grk" title="laros">&#955;&#945;&#961;&#972;&#962;</span> dainty or sweet), the melted and strained
fat of the common hog. Properly it is prepared from the &ldquo;leaf&rdquo;
or fat of the bowel and kidneys, but in commerce the term
as applied to products which include fat obtained from other
parts of the animal and sometimes containing no &ldquo;leaf&rdquo; at all.
Lard of various grades is made in enormous quantities by
the great pork-packing houses at Chicago and elsewhere in
America. &ldquo;Neutral lard&rdquo; is prepared at a temperature of
40°-50° C. from freshly killed hogs; the finest quality, used
for making oleomargarine, is got from the leaf, while the second,
employed by biscuit and pastry bakers, is obtained from the
fat of the back. Steam heat is utilized in extracting inferior
qualities, such as &ldquo;choice lard&rdquo; and &ldquo;prime steam lard,&rdquo;
the source of the latter being any fat portion of the animal.
Lard is a pure white fat of a butter-like consistence; its specific
gravity is about 0.93, its solidifying point about 27°-30° C.,
and its melting point 35°-45° C. It contains about 60% of
olein and 40% of palmitin and stearin. Adulteration is common,
the substances used including &ldquo;stearin&rdquo; both of beef and of
mutton, and vegetable oils such as cotton seed oil: indeed,
mixtures have been sold as lard that contain nothing but such
adulterants. In the pharmacopoeia lard figures as <i>adeps</i> and
is employed as a basis for ointments. Benzoated lard, used for
the same purpose, is prepared by heating lard with 3% of
powdered benzoin for two hours; it keeps better than ordinary
lard, but has slightly irritant properties.</p>

<p>Lard oil is the limpid, clear, colourless oil expressed by hydraulic
pressure and gentle heat from lard; it is employed for burning
and for lubrication. Of the solid residue, lard &ldquo;stearine,&rdquo;
the best qualities are utilized for making oleomargarine, the
inferior ones in the manufacture of candles.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LARDNER, DIONYSIUS<a name="ar167" id="ar167"></a></span> (1793-1859), Irish scientific writer,
was born at Dublin on the 3rd of April 1793. His father, a
solicitor, wished his son to follow the same calling. After
some years of uncongenial desk work, Lardner entered Trinity
College, Dublin, and graduated B.A. in 1817. In 1828 he
became professor of natural philosophy and astronomy at
University College, London, a position he held till 1840, when
he eloped with a married lady, and had to leave the country.
After a lecturing tour through the principal cities of the United
States, which realized £40,000, he returned to Europe in 1845.
He settled at Paris, and resided there till within a few months
of his death, which took place at Naples on the 29th of April
1859.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Though lacking in originality or brilliancy, Lardner showed
himself to be a successful popularizer of science. He was the author
of numerous mathematical and physical treatises on such subjects
as algebraic geometry (1823), the differential and integral calculus
(1825), the steam engine (1828), besides hand-books on various
departments of natural philosophy (1854-1856); but it is as the
editor of <i>Lardner&rsquo;s Cabinet Cyclopaedia</i> (1830-1844) that he is best
remembered. To this scientific library of 134 volumes many of the
ablest savants of the day contributed, Lardner himself being the
author of the treatises on arithmetic, geometry, heat, hydrostatics
and pneumatics, mechanics (in conjunction with Henry Kater)
and electricity (in conjunction with C. V. Walker). The <i>Cabinet
Library</i> (12 vols., 1830-1832) and the <i>Museum of Science and Art</i>
(12 vols., 1854-1856) are his other chief undertakings. A few
original papers appear in the Royal Irish Academy&rsquo;s <i>Transactions</i>
(1824), in the Royal Society&rsquo;s <i>Proceedings</i> (1831-1836) and in the
Astronomical Society&rsquo;s <i>Monthly Notices</i> (1852-1853); and two
<i>Reports</i> to the British Association on railway constants (1838, 1841)
are from his pen.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LARDNER, NATHANIEL<a name="ar168" id="ar168"></a></span> (1684-1768), English theologian,
was born at Hawkhurst, Kent. After studying for the Presbyterian
ministry in London, and also at Utrecht and Leiden,
he took licence as a preacher in 1709, but was not successful.
In 1713 he entered the family of a lady of rank as tutor and
domestic chaplain, where he remained until 1721. In 1724
he was appointed to deliver the Tuesday evening lecture in the
Presbyterian chapel, Old Jewry, London, and in 1729 he became
assistant minister to the Presbyterian congregation in Crutched
Friars. He was given the degree of D.D. by Marischal College,
Aberdeen, in 1745. He died at Hawkhurst on the 24th of July
1768.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>An anonymous volume of <i>Memoirs</i> appeared in 1769; and a life
by Andrew Kippis is prefixed to the edition of the <i>Works</i> of Lardner,
published in 11 vols., 8vo in 1788, in 4 vols. 4to in 1817, and 10 vols.
8vo in 1827. The full title of his principal work&mdash;a work which,
though now out of date, entitles its author to be regarded as the
founder of modern critical research in the field of early Christian
literature&mdash;is <i>The Credibility of the Gospel History; or the Principal

of part ii., in 12 vols. 8vo, began in 1733 and ended in 1755. In 1730
there was a second edition of part i., and the <i>Additions and Alterations</i>
were also published separately. A <i>Supplement</i>, otherwise entitled
<i>A History of the Apostles and Evangelists, Writers of the New Testament</i>,
was added in 3 vols. (1756-1757), and reprinted in 1760. Other
works by Lardner are <i>A Large Collection of Ancient Jewish and
Heathen Testimonies to the Truth of the Christian Revelation, with
Notes and Observations</i> (4 vols., 4to, 1764-1767); <i>The History of

<p><span class="bold">LAREDO,<a name="ar169" id="ar169"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of Webb county, Texas,
U.S.A., and a sub-port of entry, on the Rio Grande opposite
Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, and 150 m. S. of San Antonio. Pop.
(1900) 13,429, of whom 6882 were foreign-born (mostly Mexicans)
and 82 negroes; (1910 census) 14,855. It is served by
the International &amp; Great Northern, the National of Mexico,
the Texas Mexican and the Rio Grande &amp; Eagle Pass railways,
and is connected by bridges with Nuevo Laredo. Among the
principal buildings are the U.S. Government Building, the
City Hall and the County Court House; and the city&rsquo;s institutions
include the Laredo Seminary (1882) for boys and girls, the
Mercy Hospital, the National Railroad of Mexico Hospital and
an Ursuline Convent. Loma Vista Park (65 acres) is a pleasure
resort, and immediately W. of Laredo on the Rio Grande
is Fort McIntosh (formerly Camp Crawford), a United States
military post. Laredo is a jobbing centre for trade between
the United States and Mexico, and is a sub-port of entry in the
Corpus Christi Customs District. It is situated in a good farming
and cattle-raising region, irrigated by water from the Rio Grande.
The principal crop is Bermuda onions; in 1909 it was estimated
that 1500 acres in the vicinity were devoted to this crop, the
average yield per acre being about 20,000 &#8468;. There are coal
mines about 25 m. above Laredo on the Rio Grande, and natural
gas was discovered about 28 m. E. in 1908. The manufacture
of bricks is an important industry. Laredo was named from
the seaport in Spain, and was founded in 1767 as a Mexican town;
it originally included what is now Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, and
was long the only Mexican town on the left bank of the river.
It was captured in 1846 by a force of Texas Rangers, and in
1847 was occupied by U.S. troops under General Lamar. In
1852 it was chartered as a city of Texas.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA RÉOLE,<a name="ar170" id="ar170"></a></span> a town of south-western France, capital of an
arrondissement in the department of Gironde, on the right bank
of the Gironde, 38 m. S.E. of Bordeaux by rail. Pop. (1906)
3469. La Réole grew up round a monastery founded in the
7th or 8th century, which was reformed in the 11th century and
took the name of <i>Regula</i>, whence that of the town. A church
of the end of the 12th century and some of the buildings (18th
century) are left. There is also a town hall of the 12th and
14th centuries. The town fortifications were dismantled by
order of Richelieu, but remains dating from the 12th and 14th
centuries are to be seen, as well as a ruined château built by
Henry II. of England. La Réole has a sub-prefecture, a tribunal
of first instance, a communal college and an agricultural school.
The town is the centre of the district in which the well-known
breed of Bazadais cattle is reared. It is an agricultural market
and carries on trade in the wine of the region together with
liqueur distillery and the manufacture of casks, rope, brooms, &amp;c.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LARES<a name="ar171" id="ar171"></a></span> (older form <i>Lases</i>), Roman tutelary deities. The
word is generally supposed to mean &ldquo;lords,&rdquo; and identified
with Etruscan <i>larth</i>, <i>lar</i>; but this is by no means certain. The
attempt to harmonize the Stoic demonology with Roman
religion led to the Lares being compared with the Greek &ldquo;heroes&rdquo;
during the period of Greco-Roman culture, and the word is
frequently translated <span class="grk" title="hêrôes">&#7973;&#961;&#969;&#949;&#962;</span>. In the later period of the republic
they are confounded with the Penates (and other deities), though
the distinction between them was probably more sharply marked
in earlier times. They were originally gods of the cultivated
fields, worshipped by each household where its allotment joined
those of others (see below). The distinction between public
and private Lares existed from early times. The latter were
worshipped in the house by the family alone, and the household
Lar (<i>familiaris</i>) was conceived of as the centre-point of the
family and of the family cult. The word itself (in the singular)
came to be used in the general sense of &ldquo;home.&rdquo; It is certain
that originally each household had only one Lar; the plural
was at first only used to include other classes of Lares, and only
gradually, after the time of Cicero, ousted the singular. The
image of the Lar, made of wood, stone or metal, sometimes
even of silver, stood in its special shrine (<i>lararium</i>), which in
early times was in the atrium, but was afterwards transferred
to other parts of the house, when the family hearth was removed
from the atrium. In some of the Pompeian houses the <i>lararium</i>
was represented by a niche only, containing the image of the lar.
It was usually a youthful figure, dressed in a short, high-girt
tunic, holding in one hand a <i>rhyton</i> (drinking-horn), in the other
a <i>patera</i> (cup). Under the Empire we find usually two of these,
one on each side of the central figure of the Genius of the head
of the household, sometimes of Vesta the hearth-deity. The
whole group was called indifferently Lares or Penates. A prayer
was said to the Lar every morning, and at each meal offerings
of food and drink were set before him; a portion of these was
placed on the hearth and afterwards shaken into the fire. Special
sacrifices were offered on the kalends, nones, and ides of every
month, and on the occasion of important family events. Such
events were the birthday of the head of the household; the
assumption of the <i>toga virilis</i> by a son; the festival of the
Caristia in memory of deceased members of the household;
recovery from illness; the entry of a young bride into the house
for the first time; return home after a long absence. On these
occasions the Lares were crowned with garlands, and offerings of
cakes and honey, wine and incense, but especially swine, were
laid before them. Their worship persisted throughout the
pagan period, although its character changed considerably in
later times. The emperor Alexander Severus had images of
Abraham, Christ and Alexander the Great among his household
Lares.</p>

<p>The public Lares belonged to the state religion. Amongst
these must be included, at least after the time of Augustus, the
<i>Lares compitales</i>. Originally two in number, mythologically the
sons of Mercurius and Lara (or Larunda), they were the presiding
deities of the cross-roads (<i>compita</i>), where they had their special
chapels. It has been maintained by some that they are the twin
brothers so frequent in early religions, the Romulus and Remus
of the Roman foundation legends. Their sphere of influence
included not only the cross-roads, but the whole neighbouring
district of the town and country in which they were situated.
They had a special annual festival, called Compitalia, to which
public games were added some time during the republican
period. When the colleges of freedmen and slaves, who assisted
the presidents of the festival, were abolished by Julius Caesar,
it fell into disuse. Its importance was revived by Augustus,
who added to these Lares his own Genius, the religious personification
of the empire.</p>

<p>The state itself had its own Lares, called <i>praestites</i>, the protecting
patrons and guardians of the city. They had a temple and
altar on the Via Sacra, near the Palatine, and were represented
on coins as young men wearing the chlamys, carrying lances,
seated, with a dog, the emblem of watchfulness, at their feet.
Mention may also be made of the <i>Lares grundules</i>, whose worship
was connected with the white sow of Alba Longa and its thirty
young (the epithet has been connected with <i>grunnire</i>, to grunt):
the <i>viales</i>, who protected travellers; the <i>hostilii</i>, who kept off
the enemies of the state; the <i>permarini</i>, connected with the sea,
to whom L. Aemilius Regillus, after a naval victory over
Antiochus (190 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), vowed a temple in the Campus Martius,
which was dedicated by M. Aemilius Lepidus the censor in
179.</p>

<p>The old view that the Lares were the deified ancestors of the
family has been rejected lately by Wissowa, who holds that the
Lar was originally the protecting spirit of a man&rsquo;s lot of arable
land, with a shrine at the <i>compitum</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the spot where the path
bounding his arable met that of another holding; and thence
found his way into the house.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA RÉVELLIÈRE-LÉPEAUX, LOUIS MARIE DE<a name="ar172" id="ar172"></a></span> (1753-1824),
French politician, member of the Directory, the son of
J. B. de la Révellière, was born at Montaign (Vendée), on the
24th of August 1753. The name of Lépeaux he adopted from a
small property belonging to his family, and he was known locally
as M. de Lépeaux. He studied law at Angers and Paris, being
called to the bar in 1775. A deputy to the states-general in
1789, he returned at the close of the session to Angers, where with
his school-friends J. B. Leclerc and Urbain René Pilastre he
sat on the council of Maine-et-Loire, and had to deal with the
first Vendéen outbreaks. In 1792 he was returned by the
department to the Convention, and on the 19th of November
he proposed the famous decree by which France offered protection
to foreign nations in their struggle for liberty. Although La
Révellière-Lépeaux voted for the death of Louis XVI., he was
not in general agreement with the extremists. Proscribed with
the Girondins in 1793 he was in hiding until the revolution of
9.10 Thermidor (27th and 28th of July 1794). After serving on
the commission to prepare the initiation of the new constitution
he became in July 1795 president of the Assembly, and shortly
afterwards a member of the Committee of Public Safety. His
name stood first on the list of directors elected, and he became
president of the Directory. Of his colleagues he was in alliance
with Jean François Rewbell and to a less degree with Barras,
but the greatest of his fellow-directors, Lazare Carnot, was the
object of his undying hatred. His policy was marked by a bitter
hostility to the Christian religion, which he proposed to supplant
as a civilizing agent by theophilanthropy, a new religion invented
by the English deist David Williams. The credit of the <i>coup
d&rsquo;état</i> of 18 Fructidor (4th of September 1797), by which the
allied directors made themselves supreme, La Révellière arrogated
to himself in his <i>Mémoires</i>, which in this as in other matters
must be read with caution. Compelled to resign by the revolution
of 30 Prairial (18th of June 1799) he lived in retirement in
the country, and even after his return to Paris ten years later took
no part in public affairs. He died on the 27th of March 1824.</p>

1690. A church of the 12th, 13th and 15th centuries and the
old castle of the bishops of Viviers, lords of Largentière, now
used as a hospital, are the chief buildings. The town is the
seat of a sub-prefect and of a tribunal of first instance; and has
silk-mills, and carries on silk-spinning, wine-growing and trade

<p><span class="bold">LARGILLIÈRE, NICOLAS<a name="ar174" id="ar174"></a></span> (1656-1746), French painter, was
born at Paris on the 20th of October 1656. His father, a merchant,
took him to Antwerp at the age of three, and while a lad he
spent nearly two years in London. The attempt to turn his
attention to business having failed, he entered, some time after
his return to Antwerp, the studio of Goubeau, quitting this at
the age of eighteen to seek his fortune in England, where he was
befriended by Lely, who employed him for four years at Windsor.
His skill attracted the notice of Charles II., who wished to retain
him in his service, but the fury aroused against Roman Catholics
by the Rye House Plot alarmed Largillière, and he went to Paris,
where he was well received by Le Brun and Van der Meulen.
In spite of his Flemish training, his reputation, especially as a
portrait-painter, was soon established; his brilliant colour and
lively touch attracted all the celebrities of the day&mdash;actresses,
public men and popular preachers flocking to his studio. Huet,
bishop of Avranches, Cardinal de Noailles, the Duclos and
President Lambert, with his beautiful wife and daughter, are
amongst his most noted subjects. It is said that James II.
recalled Largillière to England on his accession to the throne in
1685, that he declined the office of keeper of the royal collections,
but that, during a short stay in London, he painted portraits of the
king, the queen and the prince of Wales. This last is impossible,
as the birth of the prince did not take place till 1688; the three
portraits, therefore, painted by Largillière of the prince in his
youth must all have been executed in Paris, to which city he
returned some time before March 1686, when he was received by
the Academy as a member, and presented as his diploma picture
the fine portrait of Le Brun, now in the Louvre. He was received
as an historical painter; but, although he occasionally produced
works of that class (&ldquo;Crucifixion,&rdquo; engraved by Roettiers),
and also treated subjects of still life, it was in historical portraits
that he excelled. Horace Walpole states that he left in London
those of Pierre van der Meulen and of Sybrecht. Several of his
works are at Versailles. The church of St Étienne du Mont at
Paris contains the finest example of Largillière&rsquo;s work when
dealing with large groups of figures; it is an <i>ex voto</i> offered by
the city to St Geneviève, painted in 1694, and containing portraits
of all the leading officers of the municipality. Largillière
passed through every post of honour in the Academy, until in
1743 he was made chancellor. He died on the 20th of March
1746. Jean Baptiste Oudry was the most distinguished of his
pupils. Largillière&rsquo;s work found skilful interpreters in Van
Schuppen, Edelinck, Desplaces, Drevet, Pitou and other
engravers.</p>

Glasgow by the Glasgow &amp; South-Western railway. Its fine
beach and dry, bracing climate have attracted many wealthy
residents, and the number of summer visitors is also large.
The public buildings include the Clark hospital, the Victoria
infirmary convalescent home and the Stevenson institute and
mechanics&rsquo; library. Skelmorlie Aisle, the sole relic of the old
parish church of St Columba, was converted into a mausoleum
in 1636. Near it a mound covers remains, possibly those of the
Norwegians who fell in the battle (1263) between Alexander III.
and Haco, king of Norway. The harbour is used mainly by
Clyde passenger steamers and yachtsmen. From the quay a

rail (20 m. direct), 984 ft. above sea-level. Pop. (1901) 7044.
The cathedral, completed in 1319, has a good Gothic façade; the
interior has to some extent been spoilt by later restoration.
The campanile rests upon a Gothic arch erected in 1451. The
Palazzo Comunale has a courtyard of the 16th century. That
the ancient town (which is close to the modern) existed
before the Roman supremacy had extended so far is proved by
the coins. It lay in the 2nd Augustan region (Apulia), but the
people belonged to the Frentani by race. Its strong position gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>217</span>
it importance in the military history of Italy from the Hannibalic
wars onwards. The town was a <i>municipium</i>, situated on the
main road to the S.E., which left the coast at Histonium (Vasto)
and ran from Larinum E. to Sipontum. From Larinum a branch
road ran to Bovianum Vetus. Remains of its city walls, of its
amphitheatre and also of baths, &amp;c., exist, and it did not cease
to be inhabited until after the earthquake of 1300, when the
modern city was established. Cluentius, the client of Cicero,
who delivered a speech in his favour, was a native of Larinum,
his father having been praetor of the allied forces in the Social
War.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LARISSA<a name="ar178" id="ar178"></a></span> (Turk. <i>Yeni Shehr</i>, &ldquo;new town&rdquo;), the most important
town of Thessaly, situated in a rich agricultural district
on the right bank of the Salambria (Peneios, Peneus, Peneius),
about 35 m. N.W. of Volo, with which it is connected by rail.
Pop. (1889) 13,610, (1907) 18,001. Till 1881 it was the seat of a
pasha in the vilayet of Jannina; it is now the capital of the Greek
province and the seat of a nomarch. Its long subjection to
Turkey has left little trace of antiquity, and the most striking
features in the general view are the minarets of the disused
mosques (only four are now in use) and the Mahommedan
burying-grounds. It was formerly a Turkish military centre and
most of the people were of Turkish blood. In the outskirts is a
village of Africans from the Sudan&mdash;a curious remnant of the
forces collected by Ali Pasha. The manufactures include Turkish
leather, cotton, silk and tobacco; trade and industry, however, are
far from prosperous, though improving owing to the immigration
of the Greek commercial element. Fevers and agues are
prevalent owing to bad drainage and the overflowing of the river;
and the death-rate is higher than the birth-rate. A considerable
portion of the Turkish population emigrated in 1881; a further
exodus took place in 1898. The department of Larissa had
in 1907 a population of 95,066.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Larissa, written Larisa on ancient coins and inscriptions, is near
the site of the Homeric Argissa. It appears in early times, when
Thessaly was mainly governed by a few aristocratic families, as an
important city under the rule of the Aleuadae, whose authority
extended over the whole district of Pelasgiotis. This powerful
family possessed for many generations before 369 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> the privilege
of furnishing the Tagus, or generalissimo, of the combined Thessalian
forces. The principal rivals of the Aleuadae were the Scopadae of
Crannon, the remains of which (called by the Turks <i>Old Larissa</i>) are
about 14 m. to the S.W. The inhabitants sided with Athens during
the Peloponnesian War, and during the Roman invasion their city
was of considerable importance. Since the 5th century it has been
the seat of an archbishop, who has now fifteen suffragans. Larissa
was the headquarters of Ali Pasha during the Greek War of Independence,
and of the crown prince Constantine during the Greco-Turkish
War; the flight of the Greek army from this place to Pharsala took
place on the 23rd of April 1897. Notices of some ancient inscriptions
found at Larissa are given by Miller in <i>Mélanges philologiques</i> (Paris,
1880); several sepulchral reliefs were found in the neighbourhood
in 1882. A few traces of the ancient acropolis and theatre are still
visible.</p>

<p>The name Larissa was common to many &ldquo;Pelasgian&rdquo; towns, and
apparently signified a fortified city or <i>burg</i>, such as the citadel of
Argos. Another town of the name in Thessaly was Larissa Cremaste,
surnamed Pelasgia (Strabo ix. p. 440), situated on the slope of Mt.
Othrys.</p>

<p><span class="bold">L&#256;RIST&#256;N,<a name="ar179" id="ar179"></a></span> a sub-province of the province of Fars in Persia,
bounded E. and N.E. by Kerman and S. by the Persian Gulf.
It lies between 26° 30&prime; and 28° 25&prime; N. and between 52° 30&prime; and
55° 30&prime; E. and has an extreme breadth and length of 120 and
210 m. respectively, with an area of about 20,000 sq. m. Pop.
about 90,000. Laristan consists mainly of mountain ranges in
the north and east, and of arid plains varied with rocky hills and
sandy valleys stretching thence to the coast. In the highlands,
where some fertile upland tracts produce corn, dates and other
fruits, the climate is genial, but elsewhere it is extremely sultry,
and on the low-lying coast lands malarious. Good water is
everywhere so scarce that but for the rain preserved in cisterns
the country would be mostly uninhabitable. Many cisterns are
infested with Guinea worm (<i>filaria medinensis</i>, Gm.). The
coast is chiefly occupied by Arab tribes who were virtually independent,
paying merely a nominal tribute to the shah&rsquo;s government
until 1898. They reside in small towns and mud forts
scattered along the coast. The people of the interior are mostly
of the old Iranian stock, and there are also a few nomads of the
Turkish Bah&#257;rl&#363; tribe which came to Persia in the 11th century
when the province was subdued by a Turkish chief. Laristan
remained an independent state under a Turkish ruler until 1602,
when Shah Ibrahim Khan was deposed and put to death by
Shah &lsquo;Abbas the Great. The province is subdivided into eight
districts: (1) Lar, the capital and environs, with 34 villages;
(2) Bikhah Ihsham with 11; (3) Bikhah Fal with 10; (4)
Jehangiriyeh with 30; (5) Shibkuh with 36; (6) Fumistan with
13; (7) Kauristan with 4; (8) Mazayijan with 6 villages.
Lingah, with its principal place Bander Lingah and 11 villages,
formerly a part of Laristan, is now included in the &ldquo;Persian
Gulf Ports,&rdquo; a separate administrative division. Laristan is
famous for the condiment called <i>m&#257;hi&#257;beh</i> (fish-jelly), a compound
of pounded small sprat-like fish, salt, mustard, nutmeg,
cloves and other spices, used as a relish with nearly all foods.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LARIVEY, PIERRE<a name="ar180" id="ar180"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1550-1612), French dramatist, of
Italian origin, was the son of one of the Giunta, the famous
printers of Florence and Venice. The family was established
at Troyes and had taken the name of Larivey or L&rsquo;Arrivey,
by way of translation from <i>giunto</i>. Pierre Larivey appears to
have cast horoscopes, and to have acted as clerk to the chapter
of the church of St Étienne, of which he eventually became
a canon. He has no claim to be the originator of French comedy.
The <i>Corrivaux</i> of Jean de la Taille dates from 1562, but Larivey
naturalized the Italian comedy of intrigue in France. He
adapted, rather than translated, twelve Italian comedies into
French prose. The first volume of the <i>Comédies facétieuses</i>
appeared in 1579, and the second in 1611. Only nine in all were
printed.<a name="fa1m" id="fa1m" href="#ft1m"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The licence of the manners depicted in these plays
is matched by the coarseness of the expression. Larivey&rsquo;s
merit lies in the use of popular language in dialogue, which often
rises to real excellence, and was not without influence on Molière
and Regnard. Molière&rsquo;s <i>L&rsquo;Avare</i> owes something to the scene
in Larivey&rsquo;s masterpiece, <i>Les Esprits</i>, where Séverin laments
the loss of his purse, and the opening scene of the piece seems
to have suggested Regnard&rsquo;s <i>Retour imprévu</i>. It is uncertain
whether Larivey&rsquo;s plays were represented, though they were
evidently written for the stage. In any case prose comedy
gained very little ground in popular favour before the time of
Molière. Larivey was the author of many translations, varying
in subject from the <i>Facétieuses nuits</i> (1573) of Straparola to the
<i>Humanité de Jésus-Christ</i> (1604) from Pietro Aretino.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LARK<a name="ar181" id="ar181"></a></span> (O. Eng. <i>láwerce</i>, Ger. <i>Lerche</i>, Dan. <i>Laerke</i>, Dutch <i>Leeuwerik</i>),
a bird&rsquo;s name used in a rather general sense, the specific
meaning being signified by a prefix, as skylark, titlark, woodlark.
It seems to be nearly conterminous with the Latin <i>Alauda</i> as
used by older authors; and, though this was to some extent
limited by Linnaeus, several of the species included by him
under the genus he so designated have long since been referred
elsewhere. By Englishmen the word lark, used without qualification,
almost invariably means the skylark, <i>Alauda arvensis</i>,
which, as the best-known and most widely spread species throughout
Europe, has been invariably considered the type of the genus.
Of all birds it holds unquestionably the foremost place in English
literature. It is one of the most favourite cage birds, as it will
live for many years in captivity, and, except in the season of
moult, will pour forth its thrilling song many times in an hour
for weeks or months together. The skylark is probably the most
plentiful of the class in western Europe. Not only does it
frequent almost all unwooded districts in that quarter of the
globe, but, unlike most birds, its numbers increase with the spread
of agricultural improvement. Nesting chiefly in the growing
corn, its eggs and young are protected in a great measure from
molestation; and, as each pair of birds will rear several broods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>218</span>
in the season, their produce on the average may be set down
as at least quadrupling the original stock&mdash;the eggs in each
nest varying from five to three. Young larks leave their birthplace
as soon as they can shift for themselves. When the
stubbles are cleared, old and young congregate in flocks.</p>

<p>In Great Britain in the autumn they give place to others
coming from more northerly districts, and then as winter succeeds
in great part vanish, leaving but a tithe of the numbers previously
present. On the approach of severe weather great flocks arrive
from the continent of Europe. On the east coast of both Scotland
and England this immigration has been noticed as occurring
in a constant stream for as many as three days in succession.
Farther inland the birds are observed &ldquo;in numbers simply
incalculable,&rdquo; and &ldquo;in countless hundreds.&rdquo; In these migrations
enormous numbers are netted for the markets, but the rate of
reproduction is so rapid, and the conditions of life so favourable
in Europe that there is no reason to fear any serious diminution
in the numbers of the species.</p>

<p>The skylark&rsquo;s range extends across the Old World from the
Faeroe to the Kurile Islands. In winter it occurs in North
China, Nepal, the Punjab, Persia, Palestine, Lower Egypt
and Barbary. It sometimes strays to Madeira, and has been
killed in Bermuda, though its unassisted appearance there is
doubtful. It has been successfully introduced on Long Island,
in the state of New York, into Hawaii and into New Zealand&mdash;in
which latter it has become as troublesome a denizen as are
some other subjects upon which acclimatization societies have
exercised their activity.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:468px; height:271px" src="images/img218a.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;A, <i>Alauda agrestis</i>; B, <i>Alauda arvensis</i>.</td></tr></table>

<p>Allied to the skylark a considerable number of species have
been described, of which perhaps a dozen may be deemed valid,
besides a supposed local race, <i>Alauda agrestis</i>, the difference
between which and the normal bird is shown in the annexed
woodcut (fig. 1), kindly lent to this work by H. E. Dresser, in
whose <i>Birds of Europe</i> it is described at length. These are found
in various parts of Africa and Asia.</p>

<p>The woodlark, <i>Lullula arborea</i>, is a much more local and, therefore,
a far less numerous bird than the skylark, from which it
may be easily distinguished by its finer bill, shorter tail, more
spotted breast and light superciliary stripe. Though not actually
inhabiting woods, as its common name might imply, it is seldom
found far from trees. Its song wants the variety and power of
the skylark&rsquo;s, but has a resonant sweetness peculiarly its own.
The bird, however, requires much care in captivity. It has by
no means so wide a range as the skylark, and perhaps the most
eastern locality recorded for it is Erzerum, while its appearance
in Egypt and even in Algeria must be accounted rare.</p>

<p>Not far removed from the foregoing is a group of larks characterized
by a larger crest, a stronger and more curved bill,
a rufous lining to the wings, and some other minor features. This
group has been generally termed <i>Galerita</i>, and has for its type
the crested lark, the <i>Alauda cristata</i> of Linnaeus, a bird common
enough in parts of France and some other countries of the
European continent, and one which has been obtained several
times in the British Islands. Many of the birds of this group
frequent the borders if not the interior of deserts, and such as
do so exhibit a more or less pale coloration, whereby they are
assimilated in hue to that of their haunts. The same characteristic
may be observed in several other groups&mdash;especially
those known as belonging to the genera <i>Calandrella</i>, <i>Ammomanes</i>
and <i>Certhilauda</i>, some species of which are of a light sandy
or cream colour. The genus last named is of very peculiar
appearance, presenting in some respects an extraordinary
resemblance to the hoopoes, so much so that the first specimen
described was referred to the genus <i>Upupa</i>, and named <i>U.
alaudipes</i>. The resemblance, however, is merely one of analogy.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">

B, <i>Rhamphocorys clot-bey</i>.</td></tr></table>

<p>There is, however, abundant evidence of the susceptibility
of the Alaudine structure to modification from external circumstances&mdash;in
other words, of its plasticity; and perhaps no
homogeneous group of <i>Passeres</i> could be found which better
displays the working of natural selection. Almost every
character that among Passerine birds is accounted most sure
is in the larks found subject to modification. The form of the
bill varies in an extraordinary degree. In the woodlark (fig.
2, A), already noticed, it is almost as slender as a warbler&rsquo;s;
in <i>Ammomanes</i> it is short; in <i>Certhilauda</i> (fig. 2, B) it is elongated
and curved; in <i>Pyrrhulauda</i> and <i>Melanocorypha</i> (fig.
3, A) it is stout and finchlike; while in <i>Rhamphocorys</i> (fig.
3, B) it is exaggerated to an extent that surpasses almost any
Fringilline form, exceeding in its development that found in
some members of the perplexing genus <i>Paradoxornis</i>, and even
presenting a resemblance to the same feature in the far-distant
<i>Anastomus</i>&mdash;the tomia of the maxilla not meeting those of the
mandibula along their whole length, but leaving an open space
between them. The hind claw, generally greatly elongated in
larks, is in <i>Calandrella</i> (fig. 4) and some other genera reduced
to a very moderate size. The wings exhibit almost every
modification, from the almost entire abortion of the first primary
in the skylark to its considerable development (fig. 5), and from
tertials and scapulars of ordinary length to the extreme elongation
found in the <i>Motacillidae</i> and almost in certain <i>Limicolae</i>.
The most constant character indeed of the <i>Alaudidae</i> would seem
to be that afforded by the <i>podotheca</i> or covering of the tarsus,
which is scutellate behind as well as in front, but a character
easily overlooked.<a name="fa1n" id="fa1n" href="#ft1n"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>In the Old World larks are found in most parts of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>219</span>
Palaearctic, Ethiopian and Indian regions; but only one genus,
<i>Mirafra</i>, inhabits Australia, where it is represented by, so
far as is ascertained, a single species, <i>M. horsfieldi</i>; and there
is no true lark indigenous to New Zealand. In the New World
there is also only one genus, <i>Otocorys</i>, where it is represented
by many races, some of which closely approach the Old World
shore-lark, <i>O. alpestris</i>. The shore-lark is in Europe a native
of only the extreme north, but is very common near the shores
of the Varanger Fjord, and likewise breeds on mountain-tops
farther south-west, though still well within the Arctic circle.
The mellow tone of its call-note has obtained for it in Lapland
a name signifying &ldquo;bell-bird,&rdquo; and the song of the cock is
lively, though not very loud. The bird trustfully resorts to
the neighbourhood of
houses, and even
enters the villages
of East Finmark in
search of its food.
It produces at least
two broods in the
season, and towards
autumn migrates to
lower latitudes in
large flocks. These
have been observed
in winter on the
east coast of Great
Britain, and the
species instead of
being regarded, as it
once was, in the light
of an accidental
visitor to the United Kingdom, must now be deemed an almost
regular visitor, though in very varying numbers. The observations
on its habits made by Audubon in Labrador have long
been known, and often reprinted. Other congeners of this
bird are the <i>O. penicillata</i> of south-eastern Europe, Palestine
and central Asia&mdash;to which are referred by H. E. Dresser
(<i>B. Europe</i>, iv. 401) several other forms originally described
as distinct. All these birds, which have been termed horned
larks, from the tuft of elongated black feathers growing on each
side of the head, form a little group easily recognized by their
peculiar coloration, which calls to mind some of the ringed
plovers, <i>Aegialitis</i>.</p>

<p>The name of lark is also frequently applied to many birds
which do not belong to the <i>Alaudidae</i> as now understood. The
mud-lark, rock-lark, tit-lark and tree-lark are pipits (<i>q.v.</i>).
The grasshopper-lark is one of the aquatic warblers (<i>q.v.</i>),
while the so-called meadow-lark of America is an Icterus
(<i>q.v.</i>). Sand-lark and sea-lark are likewise names often given
to some of the smaller members of the <i>Limicolae</i>. Of the true
larks, <i>Alaudidae</i>, there may be perhaps about one hundred
species, and it is believed to be a physiological character of
the family that they moult but once in the year, while the
pipits, which in general appearance much resemble them, undergo
a double moult, as do others of the <i>Motacillidae</i>, to which they
are most nearly allied.</p>

districts in 1901, and has an area of 5091 sq. m.; pop. (1901)
656,083, showing an increase of 10% in the decade. Its western
part is mountainous, but the remainder is a plain of alluvium
watered by canals and well cultivated, being the most fertile
part of Sind. The staple grain-crops are rice, wheat and millets,
which are exported, together with wool, cotton and other agricultural
produce. Cotton cloth, carpets, salt and leather goods
are manufactured, and dyeing is an important industry. The

<p><span class="bold">LARKSPUR,<a name="ar184" id="ar184"></a></span> in botany, the popular name for species of
<i>Delphinium</i>, a genus of hardy herbaceous plants belonging
to the natural order Ranunculaceae (<i>q.v.</i>). They are of erect
branching habit, with the flowers in terminal racemes, often
of considerable length. Blue is the predominating colour,
but purple, pink, yellow (<i>D. Zalil</i> or <i>sulphureum</i>), scarlet (<i>D.
cardinale</i>) and white also occur; the &ldquo;spur&rdquo; is produced
by the elongation of the upper sepal. The field or rocket larkspur
(<i>D. Ajacis</i>), the branching larkspur (<i>D. consolida</i>), <i>D. cardiopetalum</i>
and their varieties, are charming annuals; height
about 18 in. The spotted larkspur <i>(D. requienii</i>) and a few
others are biennials. The perennial larkspurs, however, are the
most gorgeous of the family. There are numerous species of
this group, natives of the old and new worlds, and a great number
of varieties, raised chiefly from <i>D. exaltatum</i>, <i>D. formosum</i>
and <i>D. grandiflorum</i>. Members of this group vary from 2 ft.
to 6 ft. in height.</p>

<p>The larkspurs are of easy cultivation, either in beds or herbaceous
borders; the soil should be deeply dug and manured. The
annual varieties are best sown early in April, where they are
intended to flower, and suitably thinned out as growth is made.
The perennial kinds are increased by the division of existing
plants in spring, or by cuttings taken in spring or autumn
and rooted in pots in cold frames. The varieties cannot be
perpetuated with certainty by seed. Seed is the most popular
means, however, of raising larkspurs in the majority of gardens,
and is suitable for all ordinary purposes; it should be sown
as soon as gathered, preferably in rows in nursery beds, and
the young plants transplanted when ready. They should
be fit for the borders in the spring of the following year, and
if strong, should be planted in groups about 3 ft. apart. Delphiniums
require exposure to light and air. Given plenty
of space in a rich soil, the plants rarely require to be staked
except in windy localities.</p>

on the south coast, 23 m. S.S.E. from Nicosia. Pop. (1901)
7964. It is the principal port of the island, exporting barley,
wheat, cotton, raisins, oranges, lemons and gypsum. There
is an iron pier 450 ft. long, but vessels anchor in the bay in
from 16 to 70 ft. of water. Larnaca occupies the site of the ancient
<i>Citium</i>, but the citadel of the ancient city was used to fill up

<p><span class="bold">LA ROCHE,<a name="ar186" id="ar186"></a></span> a small town in the Belgian Ardennes, noticeable
for its antiquity and its picturesque situation. Pop. (1904)
2065. Its name is derived from its position on a rock commanding
the river Ourthe, which meanders round the little place,
and skirts the rock on which are the interesting ruins of the old
castle of the 11th century. This is supposed to have been
the site of a hunting box of Pippin, and certainly the counts
of La Roche held it in fief from his descendants, the Carolingian
rulers. In the 12th century they sold it to the counts of Luxemburg.
In the 16th and 17th centuries the French and Imperialists
frequently fought in its neighbourhood, and at Tenneville,
not far distant, is shown the tomb of an English officer named
Barnewall killed in one of these encounters in 1692. La Roche
is famous as a tourist centre on account of its fine sylvan scenery.
Among the local curiosities is the Diable-Château, a freak of
nature, being the apparent replica of a medieval castle. La

(department of Charente), which was in its possession in the
11th century. François de La Rochefoucauld (1494-1517),
godson of King Francis I., was made count in 1515. At the time
of the wars of religion the family fought for the Protestant
cause. François (1588-1650) was created duke and peer of France
by Louis XIII. in 1622. His son François was the author of
the <i>Maxims</i>, and the son of the latter acquired for his house
the estates of La Roche-Guyon and Liancourt by his marriage
with Jeanne Charlotte du Plessis-Liancourt. Alexandre, duc de
La Rochefoucauld (d. 1762), left two daughters, who married
into the Roye branch of the family. Of the numerous branches
of the family the most famous are those of Roucy, Roye, Bayers,
Doudeauville, Randan and Estissac, which all furnished distinguished

<p><span class="bold">LA ROCHEFOUCAULD, FRANÇOIS DE<a name="ar188" id="ar188"></a></span> (1613-1680), the
greatest maxim writer of France, one of her best memoir writers,
and perhaps the most complete and accomplished representative
of her ancient nobility, was born at Paris in the Rue des Petits
Champs on the 15th of September 1613. The author of the
<i>Maxims</i>, who during the lifetime of his father (see above) and
part of his own most stirring years bore the title of prince de
Marcillac, was somewhat neglected in the matter of education,
at least of the scholastic kind; but he joined the army before
he was sixteen, and almost immediately began to make a figure
in public life. He had been nominally married a year before
to Andrée de Vivonne, who seems to have been an affectionate
wife, while not a breath of scandal touches her&mdash;two points in
which La Rochefoucauld was perhaps more fortunate than he
deserved. For some years Marcillac continued to take part in
the annual campaigns, where he displayed the utmost bravery,
though he never obtained credit for much military skill. Then
he passed under the spell of Madame de Chevreuse, the first of
three celebrated women who successively influenced his life.
Through Madame de Chevreuse he became attached to the queen,
Anne of Austria, and in one of her quarrels with Richelieu
and her husband a wild scheme seems to have been formed,
according to which Marcillac was to carry her off to Brussels
on a pillion. These caballings against Richelieu, however, had
no more serious results (an eight days&rsquo; experience of the Bastille
excepted) than occasional exiles, that is to say, orders to retire
to his father&rsquo;s estates. After the death of the great minister
(1642), opportunity seemed to be favourable to the vague
ambition which then animated half the nobility of France.
Marcillac became one of the so-called <i>importants</i>, and took an
active part in reconciling the queen and Condé in a league against
Gaston of Orleans. But the growing credit of Mazarin came
in his way, and the <i>liaison</i> in which about this time (1645) he
became entangled with the beautiful duchess of Longueville
made him irrevocably a Frondeur. He was a conspicuous figure
in the siege of Paris, fought desperately in the desultory engagements
which were constantly taking place, and was severely
wounded at the siege of Mardyke. In the second Fronde Marcillac
followed the fortunes of Condé, and the death of his father,
which happened at the time (1650), gave rise to a characteristic
incident. The nobility of the province gathered to the funeral,
and the new duke de La Rochefoucauld took the opportunity of
persuading them to follow him in an attempt on the royalist
garrison of Saumur, which, however, was not successful. We
have no space to follow La Rochefoucauld through the tortuous
cabals and negotiations of the later Fronde; it is sufficient to
say that he was always brave and generally unlucky. His run
of bad fortune reached its climax in the battle of the Faubourg
Saint Antoine (1652), where he was shot through the head, and
it was thought that he would lose the sight of both eyes. It was
nearly a year before he recovered, and then he found himself
at his country seat of Verteuil, with no result of twenty years&rsquo;
fighting and intriguing except impaired health, a seriously
embarrassed fortune, and some cause for bearing a grudge
against almost every party and man of importance in the state.
He spent some years in this retirement, and he was fortunate
enough (thanks chiefly to the fidelity of Gourville, who had been
in his service, and who, passing into the service of Mazarin and
of Condé, had acquired both wealth and influence) to be able
to repair in some measure the breaches in his fortune. He did
not, however, return to court life much before Mazarin&rsquo;s death,
when Louis XIV. was on the eve of assuming absolute power,
and the turbulent aristocratic anarchy of the Fronde was a thing
utterly of the past.</p>

<p>Somewhat earlier, La Rochefoucauld had taken his place
in the salon of Madame de Sablé, a member of the old Rambouillet
coterie, and the founder of a kind of successor to it. It was
known that he, like almost all his more prominent contemporaries,
had spent his solitude in writing memoirs, while the special
literary employment of the Sablé salon was the fabrication of
<i>Sentences</i> and <i>Maxims</i>. In 1662, however, more trouble than
reputation, and not a little of both, was given to him by a
surreptitious publication of his memoirs, or what purported
to be his memoirs, by the Elzevirs. Many of his old friends were
deeply wounded, and he hastened to deny flatly the authenticity
of the publication, a denial which (as it seems, without any
reason) was not very generally accepted. Three years later
(1665) he published, though without his name, the still more
famous <i>Maxims</i>, which at once established him high among the
men of letters of the time. About the same date began the
friendship with Madame de la Fayette, which lasted till the end
of his life. The glimpses which we have of him henceforward
are chiefly derived from the letters of Madame de Sévigné, and,
though they show him suffering agonies from gout, are on the
whole pleasant. He had a circle of devoted friends; he was
recognized as a moralist and man of letters of the first rank;
he might have entered the Academy for the asking; and in the
altered measure of the times his son, the prince de Marcillac, to
whom some time before his death he resigned his titles and
honours, enjoyed a considerable position at court. Above all,
La Rochefoucauld was generally recognized by his contemporaries
from the king downward as a type of the older noblesse as it
was before the sun of the great monarch dimmed its brilliant
qualities. This position he has retained until the present day.
He died at Paris on the 17th of March 1680, of the disease which
had so long tormented him.</p>

<p>La Rochefoucauld&rsquo;s character, if considered without the
prejudice which a dislike to his ethical views has sometimes
occasioned, is thoroughly respectable and even amiable. Like
almost all his contemporaries, he saw in politics little more than
a chessboard where the people at large were but pawns. The
weight of testimony, however, inclines to the conclusion that he
was unusually scrupulous in his conduct, and that his comparative
ill-success in the struggle arose more from this scrupulousness
than from anything else. He has been charged with irresolution,
and there is some ground for admitting the charge so far as to
pronounce him one of those the keenness of whose intellect,
together with their apprehension of both sides of a question,
interferes with their capacity as men of action. But there is
no ground whatever for the view which represents the Maxims
as the mere outcome of the spite of a disappointed intriguer,
disappointed through his own want of skill rather than of
fortune.</p>

<p>His importance as a social and historical figure is, however,
far inferior to his importance in literature. His work in this
respect consists of three parts&mdash;letters, <i>Memoirs</i> and the <i>Maxims</i>.
His letters exceed one hundred in number, and are biographically
valuable, besides displaying not a few of his literary characteristics;
but they need not further detain us. The <i>Memoirs</i>,
when they are read in their proper form, yield in literary merit,
in interest, and in value to no memoirs of the time, not even to
those of Retz, between whom and La Rochefoucauld there was
a strange mixture of enmity and esteem which resulted in a
couple of most characteristic &ldquo;portraits.&rdquo; But their history is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>221</span>
unique in its strangeness. It has been said that a pirated edition
appeared in Holland, and this, despite the author&rsquo;s protest,
continued to be reprinted for some thirty years. It has been
now proved to be a mere cento of the work of half a dozen
different men, scarcely a third of which is La Rochefoucauld&rsquo;s,
and which could only have been possible at a time when it was
the habit of persons who frequented literary society to copy pell-mell
in commonplace books the MS. compositions of their friends
and others. Some years after La Rochefoucauld&rsquo;s death a new
recension appeared, somewhat less incorrect than the former, but
still largely adulterated, and this held its ground for more than a
century. Only in 1817 did anything like a genuine edition (even
then by no means perfect) appear. The <i>Maxims</i>, however, had
no such fate. The author re-edited them frequently during his
life, with alterations and additions; a few were added after his
death, and it is usual now to print the whole of them, at whatever
time they appeared, together. Thus taken, they amount to
about seven hundred in number, in hardly any case exceeding
half a page in length, and more frequently confined to two or
three lines. The view of conduct which they illustrate is usually
and not quite incorrectly summed up in the words &ldquo;everything
is reducible to the motive of self-interest.&rdquo; But though not
absolutely incorrect, the phrase is misleading. The <i>Maxims</i> are
in no respect mere deductions from or applications of any such
general theory. They are on the contrary independent judgments
on different relations of life, different affections of the
human mind, and so forth, from which, taken together, the
general view may be deduced or rather composed. Sentimental
moralists have protested loudly against this view, yet it is easier
to declaim against it in general than to find a flaw in the several
parts of which it is made up. With a few exceptions La Rochefoucauld&rsquo;s
maxims represent the matured result of the reflection
of a man deeply versed in the business and pleasures of the world,
and possessed of an extraordinarily fine and acute intellect, on
the conduct and motives which have guided himself and his
fellows. There is as little trace in them of personal spite as of
<i>forfanterie de vice</i>. But the astonishing excellence of the literary
medium in which they are conveyed is even more remarkable
than the general soundness of their ethical import. In uniting
the four qualities of brevity, clearness, fulness of meaning and
point, La Rochefoucauld has no rival. His <i>Maxims</i> are never
mere epigrams; they are never platitudes; they are never dark
sayings. He has packed them so full of meaning that it would be
impossible to pack them closer, yet there is no undue compression;
he has sharpened their point to the utmost, yet there
is no loss of substance. The comparison which occurs most
frequently, and which is perhaps on the whole the justest, is
that of a bronze medallion, and it applies to the matter no less
than to the form. Nothing is left unfinished, yet none of the
workmanship is finical. The sentiment, far from being merely
hard, as the sentimentalists pretend, has a vein of melancholy
poetry running through it which calls to mind the traditions of
La Rochefoucauld&rsquo;s devotion to the romances of chivalry.
The maxims are never shallow; each is the text for a whole
sermon of application and corollary which any one of thought
and experience can write. Add to all this that the language in
which they are written is French, still at almost its greatest
strength, and chastened but as yet not emasculated by the
reforming influence of the 17th century, and it is not necessary
to say more. To the literary critic no less than to the man of
the world La Rochefoucauld ranks among the scanty number of
pocket-books to be read and re-read with ever new admiration,
instruction and delight.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The editions of La Rochefoucauld&rsquo;s <i>Maxims</i> (as the full title runs,
<i>Réflexions ou sentences et maximes morales</i>) published in his lifetime
bear the dates 1665 (<i>editio princeps</i>), 1666, 1671, 1675, 1678. An
important edition which appeared after his death in 1693 may rank
almost with these. As long as the <i>Memoirs</i> remained in the state
above described, no edition of them need be mentioned, and none of
the complete works was possible. The previous more or less complete
editions are all superseded by that of MM Gilbert and Gourdault
(1868-1883), in the series of &ldquo;Grands Écrivains de la France,&rdquo; 3 vols.
There are still some puzzles as to the text; but this edition supplies
all available material in regard to them. The handsomest separate
edition of the <i>Maxims</i> is the so-called <i>Édition des bibliophiles</i> (1870);
but cheap and handy issues are plentiful. See the English version
by G. H. Powell (1903). Nearly all the great French critics of the
19th century have dealt more or less with La Rochefoucauld: the
chief recent monograph on him is that of J. Bourdeau in the <i>Grands
écrivains français</i> (1893).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA ROCHEFOUCAULD-LIANCOURT, FRANÇOIS ALEXANDRE FRÉDÉRIC,<a name="ar189" id="ar189"></a></span>
<span class="sc">Duc de</span> (1747-1827), French social reformer,
was born at La Roche Guyon on the 11th of January
1747, the son of François Armand de La Rochefoucauld, duc
d&rsquo;Estissac, grand master of the royal wardrobe. The duc de
Liancourt became an officer of carbineers, and married at
seventeen. A visit to England seems to have suggested the
establishment of a model farm at Liancourt, where he reared
cattle imported from England and Switzerland. He also set up
spinning machines on his estate, and founded a school of arts
and crafts for the sons of soldiers, which became in 1788 the École
des Enfants de la Patrie under royal protection. Elected to the
states-general of 1789 he sought in vain to support the cause of
royalty while furthering the social reforms he had at heart. On
the 12th of July, two days before the fall of the Bastille, he
warned Louis XVI. of the state of affairs in Paris, and met
his exclamation that there was a revolt with the answer, &ldquo;<i>Non,
sire, c&rsquo;est une révolution.</i>&rdquo; On the 18th of July he became
president of the Assembly. Established in command of a military
division in Normandy, he offered Louis a refuge in Rouen, and,
failing in this effort, assisted him with a large sum of money.
After the events of the 10th of August 1792 he fled to England,
where he was the guest of Arthur Young, and thence passed to
America. After the assassination of his cousin, Louis-Alexandre,
duc de La Rochefoucauld d&rsquo;Enville, at Gisors on the 14th of
September 1792 he assumed the title of duc de La Rochefoucauld.
He returned to Paris in 1799, but received small favour from
Napoleon. At the Restoration he entered the House of Peers,
but Louis XVIII. refused to reinstate him as master of the
wardrobe, although his father had paid 400,000 francs for
the honour. Successive governments, revolutionary and otherwise,
recognized the value of his institutions at Liancourt,
and he was for twenty-three years government inspector of his
school of arts and crafts, which had been removed to Châlons.
He was one of the first promoters of vaccination in France;
he established a dispensary in Paris, and he was an active
member of the central boards of administration for hospitals,
prisons and agriculture. His opposition to the government in
the House of Peers led to his removal in 1823 from the honorary
positions he held, while the vaccination committee, of which
he was president, was suppressed. The academies of science and
of medicine admitted him to their membership by way of
protest. Official hostility pursued him even after his death
(27th of March 1827), for the old pupils of his school were charged
by the military at his funeral. His works, chiefly on economic
questions, include books on the English system of taxation,
poor-relief and education.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His eldest son, François, duc de La Rochefoucauld (1765-1848),
succeeded his father in the House of Peers. The second, Alexandre,
comte de La Rochefoucauld (1767-1841), married a San Domingo
heiress allied to the Beauharnais family. Mme de La Rochefoucauld
became dame d&rsquo;honneur to the empress Josephine, and their eldest
daughter married a brother-in-law of Pauline Bonaparte, Princess
Borghese. La Rochefoucauld became ambassador successively to
Vienna (1805) and to the Hague (1808-1810), where he negotiated
the union of Holland with France. During the &ldquo;Hundred Days&rdquo;
he was made a peer of France. He subsequently devoted himself to
philanthropic work, and in 1822 became deputy to the Chamber and
sat with the constitutional royalists. He was again raised to the
peerage in 1831.</p>

<p>The third son, Frédéric Gaétan, marquis de La Rochefoucauld-Liancourt
(1779-1863), was a zealous philanthropist and a partisan
of constitutional monarchy. He took no part in politics after 1848.
The marquis wrote on social questions, notably on prison administration;
he edited the works of La Rochefoucauld, and the memoirs of
Condorcet; and he was the author of some vaudevilles, tragedies
and poems.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA ROCHEJACQUELEIN, DE,<a name="ar190" id="ar190"></a></span> the name of an ancient French
family of La Vendée, celebrated for its devotion to the throne
during and after the Revolution. Its original name was Duverger,
derived from a fief near Bressuire in Poitou, and its pedigree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>222</span>
is traceable to the 13th century. In 1505 Gui Duverger
married Renée, heiress of Jacques Lemartin, seigneur de La
Rochejacquelein, whose name he assumed. His grandson,
Louis Duverger, seigneur de La Rochejacquelein, was a devoted
adherent of Henry II., and was badly wounded at the battle of
Arques; other members of the family were also distinguished
soldiers, and the seigniory was raised to a countship and marquisate
in reward for their services.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the Revolution the chief of the family
was <span class="sc">Henri Louis Auguste</span>, marquis de La Rochejacquelein,
<i>maréchal de camp</i> in the royal army, who had three sons named
after himself&mdash;Henri, Louis and Auguste. The marquis fled
abroad with his second son Louis at the time of the emigration
of the nobles. He entered the service of Great Britain, and died
in San Domingo in 1802.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Henri</span>, comte de La Rochejacquelein, born at Dubertien,
near Châtillon, sur Sèvres, on the 20th of August 1772, did not
emigrate with his father. He served in the constitutional
guard of the king, and remained in Paris till the execution of
Louis XVI. He then took refuge with the marquis de Lescure
on his own estates in Poitou. When the anti-clerical policy
of the revolutionary powers provoked the rising of the peasantry
of La Vendée, he put himself at the head of the men of his
neighbourhood, and came rapidly to the front among the gentlemen
whom the peasants took for leaders. In spite of his youth
and his reluctance to assume the responsibility, he was chosen
as commander-in-chief after the defeat of the Vendéans by the
republicans at Cholet. His brilliant personal courage, his
amiability and his loyalty to the cause make him a very attractive
figure, but a commander-in-chief of the Vendéans, who came
and went as they pleased, had little real power or opportunity
to display the qualities of a general. The comte de La Rochejacquelein
had in fact to obey his army, and could only display
his personal valour in action. He could not avert the mistaken
policy which led to the rout at Le Mans, and was finally shot
in an obscure skirmish at Nouaillé on the 4th of March 1794.</p>

<p>Louis, marquis de La Rochejacquelein, the younger brother
of Henri, accompanied his father in the emigration, served in
the army of Condé, and entered the service of England in America.
He returned to France during the Consulate, and in 1801 married
the marquise de Lescure, widow of his brother&rsquo;s friend, who
was mortally wounded at Cholet. Marie Louise Victoire de
Donnissan, born at Versailles on the 25th of October 1772,
belonged to a court family and was the god-daughter of Mme
Victoire, daughter of Louis XV. At the age of seventeen she
married the marquis de Lescure, whom she accompanied in the
war of La Vendée. After his death she went through various
adventures recorded in her memoirs, first published at Bordeaux
in 1815. They are of extreme interest, and give a remarkable
picture of the war and the fortunes of the royalists. She saved
much of her own property and her first husband&rsquo;s, when a conciliatory
policy was adopted after the fall of the Terrorists.
After her second marriage she lived with her husband on her
estates, both refusing all offers to take service with Napoleon.
In 1814 they took an active part in the royalist movement in
and about Bordeaux. In 1815 the marquis endeavoured to
bring about another Vendéan rising for the king, and was
shot in a skirmish with the Imperialist forces at the Pont des
Marthes on the 4th of June 1815. The marquis died at Orleans
in 1857.</p>

<p>Their eldest son, <span class="sc">Henri Auguste Georges</span>, marquis de La
Rochejacquelein, born at Château Citran in the Gironde on
the 28th of September 1805, was educated as a soldier, served
in Spain in 1822, and as a volunteer in the Russo-Turkish War
of 1828. During the reign of Louis Philippe he adhered to the
legitimist policy of his family, but he became reconciled to the
government of Napoleon III. and was mainly known as a clerical
orator and philanthropist. He died on the 7th of January
1867.</p>

<p>His son and successor, <span class="sc">Julien Marie Gaston</span>, born at Chartres
on the 27th of March 1833, was an active legitimist deputy
in the Assembly chosen at the close of the German War of
1870-1871. He was a strong opponent of Thiers, and continued
to contest constituencies as a legitimist with varying fortunes
till his death in 1897.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA ROCHELLE,<a name="ar191" id="ar191"></a></span> a seaport of western France, capital of the
department of Charente-Inférieure, 90 m. S. by E. of Nantes
on the railway to Bordeaux. Pop. (1906) town 24,524, commune
33,858. La Rochelle is situated on the Atlantic coast on an
inlet opening off the great bay in which lie the islands of Ré
and Oléron. Its fortifications, constructed by Vauban, have a
circuit of 3½ m. with seven gates. Towards the sea are three
towers, of which the oldest (1384) is that of St Nicholas. The
apartment in the first storey was formerly used as a chapel.
The Chain Tower, built towards the end of the 14th century,
is so called from the chain which guarded the harbour at this
point; the entrance to the tidal basin was at one time spanned
by a great pointed arch between the two towers. The lantern
tower (1445-1476), seven storeys high, is surmounted by a lofty
spire and was once used as a lighthouse. Of the ancient gateways
only one has been preserved in its entirety, that of the &ldquo;Grosse
Horloge,&rdquo; a huge square tower of the 14th or 15th century,
the corner turrets of which have been surmounted with trophies
since 1746. The cathedral of La Rochelle (St Louis or St
Bartholomew) is a heavy Grecian building (1742-1762) with a
dome above the transept, erected on the site of the old
church of St Bartholomew, destroyed in the 16th century and
now represented by a solitary tower dating from the 14th
century. Externally the town-house is in the Gothic style of
the latter years of the 15th century and has the appearance of
a fortress, though its severity is much relieved by the beautiful
carving of the two entrances, of the machicolations and of the
two belfries. The buildings looking into the inner court are in
the Renaissance style (16th and early 17th centuries) and
contain several fine apartments. In the old episcopal palace
(which was in turn the residence of Sully, the prince of Condé,
Louis XIII., and Anne of Austria, and the scene of the marriage
of Alphonso VI. of Portugal with a princess of Savoy) accommodation
has been provided for a library, a collection of records and
a museum of art and antiquities. Other buildings of note are
an arsenal with an artillery museum, a large hospital, a special
Protestant hospital, a military hospital and a lunatic asylum
for the department. In the botanical gardens there are museums
of natural history. Medieval and Renaissance houses give a
peculiar character to certain districts: several have French,
Latin or Greek inscriptions of a moral or religious turn and in
general of Protestant origin. Of these old houses the most
interesting is one built in the <span class="correction" title="amended from midddle">middle</span> of the 16th century and
wrongly known as that of Henry II. The parade-ground,
which forms the principal public square, occupies the site of the
castle demolished in 1590. Some of the streets have side-arcades;
the public wells are fed from a large reservoir in the Champ
de Mars; and among the promenades are the Cours des Dames
with the statue of Admiral Duperré, and outside the Charruyer
Park on the west front of the ramparts, and the Mail, a beautiful
piece of greensward. In this direction are the sea-bathing
establishments.</p>

<p>La Rochelle is the seat of a bishopric and a prefect, and has
tribunals of first instance and of commerce, a chamber of commerce
and a branch of the Bank of France; its educational
establishments include an ecclesiastical seminary, a lycée and
a training college for girls. Ship-building, saw-milling and the
manufacture of briquettes and chemicals, sardine and tunny-preserving
and petroleum-refining are among the industries.
The rearing of oysters and mussels and the exploitation of salt
marshes is carried on in the vicinity.</p>

<p>The inlet of La Rochelle is protected by a stone mole constructed
by Richelieu and visible at low tide. The harbour, one
of the safest on the coast, is entered by a channel 2730 yds. long,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>223</span>
and comprises an outer harbour opening on the one hand into a
floating basin, on the other into a tidal basin with another floating
basin adjoining it. Behind the tidal basin is the Maubec reservoir,
the waters of which, along with those of the Marans canal, help
to scour the port and navigable channel. Some 200 sailing ships
are engaged in the fisheries, and the fish market of La Rochelle is
the most important on the west coast. The harbour is, however,
inaccessible to the largest vessels, for the accommodation of
which the port of La Pallice, inaugurated in 1891, was created.
Lying about 3 m. W.S.W. of La Rochelle, this port opens into
the bay opposite the eastern extremity of the island of Ré.
It was artificially excavated and affords safe anchorage in all
weathers. The outer port, protected by two jetties, has an area
of 29 acres and a depth of 16½ ft. below lowest tide-level. At
the extremity of the breakwater is a wharf where ships may
discharge without entering the basin. A lock connects with
the inner basin, which has an area of 27 acres, with 5900 ft. of
quayage, a minimum depth of 28 ft., and depths of 29½ ft. and
36 ft. at high, neap and spring tides. Connected with the basin
are two graving docks. La Pallice has regular communication
with South America by the vessels of the Pacific Steam Navigation
Company and by those of other companies with London,
America, West Africa, Egypt and the Far East. The port has
petroleum refineries and chemical manure works.</p>

<p>In 1906 there entered the port of La Rochelle, including the
dock of La Pallice, 441 vessels with a tonnage of 629,038, and
cleared 468 vessels with a tonnage of 664,861 (of which 235 of
241,146 tons cleared with ballast). These figures do not include
vessels entering from, or clearing for, other ports in France.
The imports (value, £1,276,000 in 1900 as compared with
£1,578,000 in 1907) include coal and patent fuel, superphosphates,
natural phosphates, nitrate of soda, pyrites, building-timber,
wines and alcohol, pitch, dried codfish, petroleum, jute, wood-pulp.
Exports (value, £1,294,000 in 1900; £1,979,000 in 1907)
include wine and brandy, fancy goods, woven goods, garments,
skins, coal and briquettes, furniture, potatoes.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>La Rochelle existed at the close of the 10th century under the name
of Rupella. It belonged to the barony of Châtelaillon, which was
annexed by the duke of Aquitaine and succeeded Châtelaillon as
chief town in Aunis. In 1199 it received a communal charter from
Eleanor, duchess of Guienne, and it was in its harbour that John
Lackland disembarked when he came to try to recover the domains
seized by Philip Augustus. Captured by Louis VIII. in 1224, it
was restored to the English in 1360 by the treaty of Brétigny, but
it shook off the yoke of the foreigner when Du Guesclin recovered
Saintonge. During the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries La Rochelle,
then an almost independent commune, was one of the great maritime
cities of France. From its harbour in 1402 Jean de Béthencourt
set out for the conquest of the Canaries, and its seamen were the
first to turn to account the discovery of the new world. The salt-tax
provoked a rebellion at Rochelle which Francis I. repressed
in person; in 1568 the town secured exemption by the payment of
a large sum. At the Reformation La Rochelle early became one of
the chief centres of Calvinism, and during the religious wars it
armed privateers which preyed on Catholic vessels in the Channel and
on the high seas. In 1571 a synod of the Protestant churches of
France was held within its walls under the presidency of Beza for the
purpose of drawing up a confession of faith. After the massacre of
St Bartholomew, La Rochelle held out for six and a half months
against the Catholic army, which was ultimately obliged to raise the
siege after losing more than 20,000 men. The peace of the 24th of
June 1573, signed by the people of La Rochelle in the name of all the
Protestant party, granted the Calvinists full liberty of worship in
several places of safety. Under Henry IV. the town remained quiet,
but under Louis XIII. it put itself again at the head of the Huguenot
party. Its vessels blockaded the mouth of the Gironde and stopped
the commerce of Bordeaux, and also seized the islands of Ré and
Oléron and several vessels of the royal fleet. Richelieu then resolved
to subdue the town once for all. In spite of the assistance
rendered by the English troops under Buckingham and in spite of
the fierce energy of their mayor Guiton, the people of La Rochelle
were obliged to capitulate after a year&rsquo;s siege (October 1628).
During this investment Richelieu raised the celebrated mole which
cut off the town from the open sea. La Rochelle then became the
principal port for the trade between France and the colony of Canada.
But the revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685) deprived it of some
thousands of its most industrious inhabitants, and the loss of Canada
by France completed for the time the ruin of its commerce. Its
privateers, however, maintained a vigorous struggle with the English
during the republic and the empire.</p>

the department of Vendée, on an eminence on the right bank
of the Yon, 48 m. S. of Nantes on the railway to Bordeaux.
Pop. (1906) town 10,666, commune 13,685. The castle of La
Roche, which probably existed before the time of the crusades,
and was frequently attacked or taken in the Hundred Years&rsquo;
War and in the wars of religion, was finally dismantled under
Louis XIII. When Napoleon in 1804 made this place, then of
no importance, the chief town of a department, the stones from
its ruins were employed in the erection of the administrative
buildings, which, being all produced at once after a regular plan,
have a monotonous effect. The equestrian statue of Napoleon I.

statue of General Travot, who was engaged in the &ldquo;pacification&rdquo;
of La Vendée; the museum, with several paintings by P. Baudry,
a native artist, of whom there is a statue in the town, are the only
objects of interest. Napoleon-Vendée and Bourbon-Vendée, the
names borne by the town according to the dominance of either
dynasty, gave place to the original name after the revolution of
1870. The town is the seat of a prefect and a court of assizes,
and has a tribunal of first instance, a chamber of commerce, a
branch of the Bank of France, a lycée for boys and training
colleges for both sexes. It is a market for farm-produce, horses
and cattle, and has flour-mills. The dog fairs of La Roche are
well known.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAROMIGUIÈRE, PIERRE<a name="ar193" id="ar193"></a></span> (1756-1837), French philosopher,
was born at Livignac on the 3rd of November 1756, and died on
the 12th of August 1837 in Paris. As professor of philosophy
at Toulouse he was unsuccessful and incurred the censure of
the parliament by a thesis on the rights of property in connexion
with taxation. Subsequently he came to Paris, where he was
appointed professor of logic in the École Normale and lectured
in the Prytanée. In 1799 he was made a member of the Tribunate,
and in 1833 of the Academy of Moral and Political
Science. In 1793 he published <i>Projet d&rsquo;éléments de metaphysique</i>,
a work characterized by lucidity and excellence of style. He
wrote also two <i>Mémoires</i>, read before the Institute, <i>Les Paradoxes
de Condillac</i> (1805) and <i>Leçons de philosophie</i> (1815-1818).
Laromiguière&rsquo;s philosophy is interesting as a revolt against
the extreme physiological psychology of the natural scientists,
such as Cabanis. He distinguished between those psychological
phenomena which can be traced directly to purely physical causes,
and the actions of the soul which originate from within itself.
Psychology was not for him a branch of physiology, nor on the
other hand did he give to his theory an abstruse metaphysical
basis. A pupil of Condillac and indebted for much of his ideology
to Destutt de Tracy, he attached a fuller importance to Attention
as a psychic faculty. Attention provides the facts, Comparison
groups and combines them, while Reason systematizes and
explains. The soul is active in its choice, <i>i.e.</i> is endowed with freewill,
and is, therefore, immortal. For natural science as a method
of discovery he had no respect. He held that its judgments are,
at the best, statements of identity, and that its so-called discoveries
are merely the reiteration, in a new form, of previous
truisms. Laromiguière was not the first to develop these views;
he owed much to Condillac, Destutt de Tracy and Cabanis. But,
owing to the accuracy of his language and the purity of his style,
his works had great influence, especially over Armand Marrast,
Cardaillac and Cousin. A lecture of his in the École Normale
impressed Cousin so strongly that he at once devoted himself to
the study of philosophy. Jouffroy and Taine agree in describing
him as one of the great thinkers of the 19th century.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LARRA, MARIANO JOSÉ DE<a name="ar194" id="ar194"></a></span> (1809-1837), Spanish satirist,
was born at Madrid in 1809. His father served as a regimental
doctor in the French army, and was compelled to leave the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>224</span>
Peninsula with his family in 1812. In 1817 Larra returned to
Spain, knowing less Spanish than French. His nature was
disorderly, his education was imperfect, and, after futile attempts
to obtain a degree in medicine or law, he made an imprudent
marriage at the age of twenty, broke with his relatives and
became a journalist. On the 27th of April 1831 he produced his
first play, <i>No más mostrador</i>, based on two pieces by Scribe and
Dieulafoy. Though wanting in originality, it is brilliantly
written, and held the stage for many years. On the 24th of
September 1834 he produced <i>Macias</i>, a play based on his own
historical novel, <i>El Doncel de Don Enrique el Doliente</i> (1834).
The drama and novel are interesting as experiments, but Larra
was essentially a journalist, and the increased liberty of the press
after the death of Ferdinand VII. gave his caustic talent an
ampler field. He was already famous under the pseudonyms of
&ldquo;Juan Pérez de Munguía&rdquo; and &ldquo;Figaro&rdquo; which he used in
<i>El Pobrecito Hablador</i> and <i>La Revista Española</i> respectively.
Madrid laughed at his grim humour; ministers feared his
vitriolic pen and courted him assiduously; he was elected as
deputy for Ávila, and a great career seemed to lie before him.
But the era of military <i>pronunciamientos</i> ruined his personal
prospects and patriotic plans. His writing took on a more
sombre tinge; domestic troubles increased his pessimism, and,
in consequence of a disastrous love-affair, he committed suicide
on the 13th of February 1837. Larra lived long enough to prove
himself the greatest prose-writer that Spain can boast during
the 19th century. He wrote at great speed with the constant fear
of the censor before his eyes, but no sign of haste is discernible
in his work, and the dexterity with which he aims his venomous
shafts is amazing. His political instinct, his abundance of ideas
and his forcible, mordant style would have given him a foremost
position at any time and in any country; in Spain, and in his
own period, they placed him beyond all rivalry.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LARSA<a name="ar195" id="ar195"></a></span> (Biblical <i>Ellasar</i>, Gen. xiv. 1), an important city
of ancient Babylonia, the site of the worship of the sun-god,
Shamash, represented by the ancient ruin mound of Senkereh
(Senkera). It lay 15 m. S.E. of the ruin mounds of Warka
(anc. <i>Erech</i>), near the east bank of the Shatt-en-Nil canal.
Larsa is mentioned in Babylonian inscriptions as early as the
time of Ur-Gur, 2700 or 2800 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, who built or restored the
<i>ziggurat</i> (stage-tower) of E-Babbar, the temple of Shamash.
Politically it came into special prominence at the time of the
Elamite conquest, when it was made the centre of Elamite
dominion in Babylonia, perhaps as a special check upon the
neighbouring Erech, which had played a prominent part in the
resistance to the Elamites. At the time of Khammurabi&rsquo;s
successful struggle with the Elamite conquerors it was ruled
by an Elamite king named Eriaku, the Arioch of the Bible,
called Rim-Sin by his Semitic subjects. It finally lost its independence
under Samsu-iluna, son of Khammurabi, <i>c.</i> 1900
<span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and from that time until the close of the Babylonian
period it was a subject city of Babylon. Loftus conducted
excavations at this site in 1854. He describes the ruins as
consisting of a low, circular platform, about 4½ m. in circumference,
rising gradually from the level of the plain to a central
mound 70 ft. high. This represents the ancient <i>ziggurat</i> of the
temple of Shamash, which was in part explored by Loftus.
From the inscriptions found there it appears that, besides the
kings already mentioned, Khammurabi, Burna-buriash (buryas)
and the great Nebuchadrezzar restored or rebuilt the temple
of Shamash. The excavations at Senkereh were peculiarly
successful in the discovery of inscribed remains, consisting
of clay tablets, chiefly contracts, but including also an important
mathematical tablet and a number of tablets of a
description almost peculiar to Senkereh, exhibiting in bas-relief
scenes of everyday life. Loftus found also the remains
of an ancient Babylonian cemetery. From the ruins it would
appear that Senkereh ceased to be inhabited at or soon after
the Persian conquest.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LARTET, EDOUARD<a name="ar196" id="ar196"></a></span> (1801-1871), French archaeologist,
was born in 1801 near Castelnau-Barbarens, department of
Gers, France, where his family had lived for more than five
hundred years. He was educated for the law at Auch and
Toulouse, but having private means elected to devote himself
to science. The then recent work of Cuvier on fossil mammalia
encouraged Lartet in excavations which led in 1834 to his first
discovery of fossil remains in the neighbourhood of Auch.
Thenceforward he devoted his whole time to a systematic
examination of the French caves, his first publication on the
subject being <i>The Antiquity of Man in Western Europe</i>
(1860), followed in 1861 by <i>New Researches on the Coexistence
of Man and of the Great Fossil Mammifers characteristic of the
Last Geological Period</i>. In this paper he made public the results
of his discoveries in the cave of Aurignac, where evidence existed
of the contemporaneous existence of man and extinct mammals.
In his work in the Périgord district Lartet had the aid of Henry
Christy (<i>q.v.</i>). The first account of their joint researches appeared
in a paper descriptive of the Dordogne caves and contents,
published in <i>Revue archéologique</i> (1864). The important discoveries
in the Madeleine cave and elsewhere were published
by Lartet and Christy under the title <i>Reliquiae Aquitanicae</i>,
the first part appearing in 1865. Christy died before the completion
of the work, but Lartet continued it until his breakdown
in health in 1870. The most modest and one of the most illustrious
of the founders of modern palaeontology, Lartet&rsquo;s work
had previously been publicly recognized by his nomination
as an officer of the Legion of Honour; and in 1848 he had
had the offer of a political post. In 1857 he had been elected
a foreign member of the Geological Society of London, and
a few weeks before his death he had been made professor of
palaeontology at the museum of the Jardin des Plantes. He
died at Seissan in January 1871.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LARVAL FORMS,<a name="ar197" id="ar197"></a></span> in biology. As is explained in the article
on <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Embryology</a></span> (<i>q.v.</i>), development and life are coextensive,
and it is impossible to point to any period in the life of an
organism when the developmental changes cease. Nevertheless
it is customary to speak of development as though it were
confined to the early period of life, during which the important
changes occur by which the uninucleated zygote acquires
the form characteristic of the species. Using the word in this
restricted sense, it is pointed out in the same article that the
developmental period frequently presents two phases, the embryonic
and the larval. During the embryonic phase the
development occurs under protection, either within the egg
envelopes, or within the maternal body, or in a brood pouch.
At the end of this phase the young organism becomes free
and uses, as a rule, its own mouth and digestive organs. If
this happens before it has approximately acquired the adult
form, it is called a larva (Lat. <i>larva</i>, ghost, spectre, mask), and
the subsequent development by which the adult form is acquired
constitutes the larval phase. In such forms the life-cycle
is divided into three phases, the embryonic, the larval and the
adult. The transition between the first two of these is always
abrupt; whereas the second and third, except in cases in which
a metamorphosis occurs (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Metamorphosis</a></span>), graduate into
one another, and it is not possible to say when the larval stage
ends and the adult begins. This is only what would be expected
when it is remembered that the developmental changes never
cease. It might be held that the presence of functional reproductive
organs, or the possibility of rapidly acquiring them,
marks off the adult phase of life from the larval. But this
test sometimes fails. In certain of the Ctenophora there is
a double sexual life; the larva becomes sexually mature and
lays eggs, which are fertilized and develop; it then loses its
generative organs and develops into the adult, which again
develops reproductive organs (<i>dissogony</i>; see Chun, <i>Die Ctenophoren
des Golfes von Neapel</i>, 1880). In certain Amphibia the
larva may develop sexual organs and breed (axolotl), but in
this case (<i>neoteny</i>) it is doubtful whether further development
may occur in the larva. A very similar phenomenon is found
in certain insect larvae (<i>Cecidomyia</i>), but in this case ova alone
are produced and develop parthenogenetically (paedogenesis).
Again in certain Trematoda larval stages known as the sporocyst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>225</span>
and redia produce ova which have the power of developing
unfertilized; in this case the larva probably has not the power
of continuing its development. It is very generally held by
philosophers that the end of life is reproduction, and there is
much to be said for this view; but, granting its truth, it is
difficult to see why the capacity for reproduction should so
generally be confined to the later stages of life. We know
by more than one instance that it is possible for the larva to
reproduce by sexual generation; why should not the phenomenon
be more common? It is impossible in the present state of our
knowledge to answer this question.</p>

<p>The conclusion, then, that we reach is that the larval phase
of life graduates into the later phases, and that it is impossible
to characterize it with precision, as we can the embryonic
phase. Nevertheless great importance has been attached, in
certain cases, to the forms assumed by the young organism when
it breaks loose from its embryonic bonds. It has been widely
held that the study of larvae is of greater importance in determining
genetic affinity than the study of adults. What justification
is there for this view? The phase of life, chosen for
the ordinary anatomical and physiological studies and labelled
as the adult phase, is merely one of the large number of stages
of structure through which the organism passes during its
free life. In animals with a well-marked larval phase, by
far the greater number of the stages of structure are included
in the larval period, for the developmental changes are more
numerous and take place with greater rapidity at the beginning
of life than in its later periods. As each of the larval stages
is equal in value for the purposes of our study to the adult
phase, it clearly follows that, if there is anything in the view
that the anatomical study of organisms is of importance in
determining their mutual relations, the study of the organism
in its various larval stages must have a greater importance
than the study of the single and arbitrarily selected stage of
life called the adult.</p>

<p>The importance, then, of the study of larval forms is admitted,
but before proceeding to it this question may be asked: What
is the meaning of the larval phase? Obviously this is part of a
larger problem: Why does an organism, as soon as it is established
at the fertilization of the ovum, enter upon a cycle of
transformations which never cease until death puts an end to
them? It is impossible to give any other answer to this question
than this, viz. that it is a property of living matter to react in a
remarkable way to external forces without undergoing destruction.
As is explained in <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Embryology</a></span>, development consists
of an orderly interaction between the organism and its environment.
The action of the environment produces certain morphological
changes in the organism. These changes enable the
organism to move into a new environment, which in its turn
produces further structural changes in the organism. These
in their turn enable, indeed necessitate, the organism to move
again into a new environment, and so the process continues until
the end of the life-cycle. The essential condition of success in
this process is that the organism should always shift into the
environment to which its new structure is suited, any failure in
this leading to impairment of the organism. In most cases the
shifting of the environment is a very gradual process, and the
morphological changes in connexion with each step of it are but
slight. In some cases, however, jumps are made, and whenever
such jumps occur we get the morphological phenomenon termed
metamorphosis. It would be foreign to our purpose to consider
this question further here, but before leaving it we may suggest,
if we cannot answer, one further question. Has the duration
and complexity of the life-cycle expanded or contracted since
organisms first appeared on the earth? According to the
current view, the life-cycle is continually being shortened at
one end by the abbreviation of embryonic development and by
the absorption of larval stages into the embryonic period, and
lengthened at the other by the evolutionary creation of new
adult phases. What was the condition of the earliest organisms?
Had they the property of reacting to external forces to the same
extent and in the same orderly manner that organisms have to-day?</p>

<p>For the purpose of obtaining light upon the genetic affinities
of an organism, a larval stage has as much importance as has
the adult stage. According to the current views of naturalists,
which are largely a product of Darwinism, it has its counterpart,
as has the adult stage, in the ancestral form from which the living
organism has been derived by descent with modification. Just
as the adult phase of the living form differs owing to evolutionary
modification from the adult phase of the ancestor, so each larval
phase will differ for the same reason from the corresponding
larval phase in the ancestral life-history. Inasmuch as the
organism is variable at every stage of its existence, and is exposed
to the action of natural selection, there is no reason why it should
escape modification at any stage. But, as the characters of
the ancestor are unknown, it is impossible to ascertain what the
modification has been, and the determination of which of the
characters of its descendant (whether larval or adult) are new
and which ancient must be conjectural. It has been customary
of late years to distinguish in larvae those characters which are
supposed to have been recently acquired as <i>caenogenetic</i>, the
ancient characters being termed <i>palingenetic</i>. These terms,
if they have any value, are applicable with equal force to adults,
but they are cumbrous, and the absence of any satisfactory test
which enables us to distinguish between a character which is
ancestral and one which has been recently acquired renders
their utility very doubtful. Just as the adult may be supposed,
on evolution doctrine, to be derived from an ancestral adult,
so the various larval stages may be supposed to have been
derived from the corresponding larval stage of the hypothetical
ancestor. If we admit organic evolution at all, we may perhaps
go so far, but we are not in a position to go further, and to assert
that each larval stage is representative of and, so to speak,
derived from some adult stage in the remote past, when the
organism progressed no further in its life-cycle than the stage
of structure revealed by such a larval form. We may perhaps
have a right to take up this position, but it is of no advantage
to us to do so, because it leads us into the realm of pure fancy.
Moreover, it assumes that an answer can be given to the question
asked above&mdash;has the life-cycle of organisms contracted or
expanded as the result of evolution? This question has not
been satisfactorily answered. Indeed we may go further and
say that naturalists have answered it in different ways according
to the class of facts they were contemplating at the moment.
If we are to consider larvae at all from the evolution point of
view, we must treat them as being representative of ancestral
larvae from which they have been derived by descent with
modification; and we must leave open the question whether
and to what extent the first organisms themselves passed through
a complicated life-cycle.</p>

<p>From the above considerations it is not surprising to find
that the larvae of different members of any group resemble each
other to the same kind of degree as do the adults, and that the
larvae of allied groups resemble one another more closely than
do the larvae of remote groups, and finally that a study of
larvae does in some cases reveal affinities which would not have
been evident from a study of adults alone. Though it is impossible
to give here an account of the larval forms of the animal
kingdom, we may illustrate these points, which are facts of
fundamental importance in the study of larvae, by a reference
to specific cases.</p>

<p>The two great groups, Annelida and Mollusca, which by their
adult structure present considerable affinity with one another,
agree in possessing a very similar larval form, known as the
<i>trochosphere</i> or <i>trochophore</i>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A typical trochosphere larva (figs. 1, 2) possesses a small, transparent
body divided into a large preoral lobe and a small postoral
region. The mouth (4) is on the ventral surface at the junction of the
preoral lobe with the hinder part of the body, and there is an anus
(7) at the hind end. Connecting the two is a curved alimentary
canal which is frequently divided into oesophagus, stomach and
intestine. There is a preoral circlet of powerful cilia, called the
&ldquo;velum&rdquo; (2), which encircles the body just anterior to the mouth
and marks off the preoral lobe, and there is very generally a second
ring of cilia immediately behind the mouth (3). At the anterior end
of the preoral lobe is a nervous thickening of the ectoderm called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>226</span>
the apical plate (1). This usually carries a tuft of long cilia or sensory
hairs, and sometimes rudimentary visual organs. Mesoblastic
bands are present, proceeding a short distance forwards from the
anus on each side of the middle ventral line (6), and at the anterior
end of each of these structures is a tube (5) which more or less
branches internally and opens on the ventral surface. The branches
of this tube end internally in peculiar cells containing a
flame-shaped
flagellum and
floating in the so-called
body cavity, into
which, however, they
do not open. These
are the primitive kidneys.
The body
cavity, which is a
space between the
ectoderm and alimentary
canal, is not
lined by mesoderm
and is traversed by a
few muscular fibres.
Such a larva is found,
almost as described,
in many Chaetopods
(fig. 1), in <i>Echiurus</i> (fig.
2), in many Gastropods
(fig. 3), and
Lamellibranchiates
(fig. 4). This typical
structure of the larva
is often departed from,
and the molluscan trochosphere
can be distinguished
from the
annelidan by the possession
of a rudiment
at least of the shell-gland
and foot (figs. 3
and 4); but in all
cases in which the
young leaves the egg
at an early stage of
development it has
a form which can
be referred without
much difficulty to the
trochosphere type just described. A larva similar to the trochosphere
in some features, particularly in possessing a preoral
ring of cilia and an apical plate, is found in the Polyzoa, and
in adult Rotifera, which latter, in their ciliary ring and excretory
organs, present some
resemblance to the trochosphere,
and are sometimes described
as permanent adult
trochospheres. But in these
phases the resemblance to the
typical forms is not nearly so close as it is in the case of the larva
of Annelida and Mollusca.</p>

<p>The cilia of the preoral and postoral bands are

<p class="pt2">The first is, in its most primitive form, a small transparent creature,
with a mouth and anus and a postoral longitudinal ciliated band (fig.
5, A). In Asteroids the band of cilia becomes divided in such a way
as to give rise to two bands, the one preoral, encircling the preoral
lobe, and the other remaining postoral (fig. 5, B). In the other
groups the band remains single and longitudinal. In all cases the
edges of the body
carrying the ciliary
bands become
sinuous (fig. 6) and
sometimes prolonged
into arms
(figs. 7-9), and
each of the four
groups has its own
type of larva. In
Asteroids, in which
the band divides,
the larva is known
as the bipinnaria
(fig. 7); in Holothurians
it is called
the auricularia (fig.
6); in Echinoids
and Ophiuroids, in
which the arms
are well marked,
it is known as the
pluteus, the
echinopluteus (fig.
9) and ophiopluteus
(fig. 8) respectively.</p>

<p>All these forms
were obviously distinct but as obviously modifications of a common
type and related to one another. They present certain remarkable
structural features which differentiate them from other larval
types except the tornaria larvae of the Enteropneusta. They
possess an alimentary canal with a mouth and anus as does the
trochosphere, but they differ altogether from that larva in having a
diverticulum of the alimentary canal which gives rise to the coelom
and to a considerable part of the mesoblast.
Further, they are without an
apical plate with its tuft of sensory hairs.</p>

<p>In Crinoids the type is different (fig. 10),
and might belong to a different phylum.
The body is opaque, and encircled by five
ciliary bands, and is without either mouth,
anus or arms, and there is a tuft of cilia
on the preoral lobe. A resemblance to
the other Echinoderm larvae is found in
the fact that coelomic diverticula of the
enteron are present.</p>

<p class="pt2">The larvae of two other groups present
certain resemblances to the typical Echinoderm
larvae. The one of these is the tornaria
larva of the Enteropneusta (fig. 11), which recalls Echinoderms
in the possession of two ciliary bands, the one preoral and the other
postoral and partly longitudinal, and in the presence of gut diverticula
which give rise to the coelom; but, like the trochosphere, it
possesses an apical plate with sensory organs on the preoral lobe. The
resemblance of the tornaria to the bipinnaria is so close that, taking
into consideration certain additional resemblances in the arrangement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>227</span>
of the coelomic vesicles which arise from the original gut diverticulum,
it is impossible to resist the conclusion that there is affinity
between the Echinoderm and Enteropneust phyla. Here we have a
case like that of the Tunicata in which an affinity which is not
evident from a study of the adult alone is revealed by a study of
the young form. The other larva which recalls the Echinoderm
type is the Actinotrocha of <i>Phoronis</i> (fig. 12), but the resemblance
is not nearly so close, being confined to the presence of a postoral
longitudinal band of cilia which is prolonged into arm-like processes.</p>

<p class="pt2">In the Crustacea the larvae are highly peculiar and share, in a
striking manner, certain of the important features of specialization
presented by the adult, viz. the presence of a strong cuticle and of
articulated appendages and the absence of cilia. They are remarkable
among larvae for the number of stages which they pass
through in attaining the adult state. However numerous these
may be, they almost always have, when first set free from the egg,
one of two forms, that of the <i>nauplius</i> (fig. 13, A) or that of the <i>zoaea</i>
(fig. 13, B). The nauplius is found throughout the group and is the
more important of the two; the zoaea is confined to the higher
members, in some of which it merely forms a stage through which the
larva, hatched as a nauplius, passes in its gradual development.
The nauplius larva is of
classic interest because its
occurrence has enabled zoologists
to determine with precision
the position in the
animal kingdom of a group,
the Cirripedia, which was
placed by the illustrious
Cuvier among the Mollusca.</p>

<p>In the Tunicata the remarkable
tadpole larva, the
structure and development
of which was first elucidated
by the great Russian naturalist,
A. Kowalevsky, possesses
a similar interest to
that of the nauplius larva of
Cirripeds, and of the tornaria
larva of the Enteropneusta,
in that it pointed the way to
the recognition of the affinities
of the Tunicata, affinities
which were entirely unsuspected
till they were revealed
by a study of the larvae.</p>
</div>

<p>With regard to the occurrence
of larvae, three
general statements may be
made. (1) They are always
associated with a small egg
in which the amount of
food yolk is not sufficient
to enable the animal to
complete its development
in the embryonic state. (2)
A free-swimming larva is
usually found in cases in
which the adult is attached
to foreign objects. (3) A
larval stage is, as a rule,
associated with internal
parasitism of the adult.
The object gained by the
occurrence of a larva in
the two last cases is to enable
the species to distribute
itself over as wide an area
as possible. It may further
be asserted that land and
fresh-water animals develop
without a larval stage much
more frequently than marine
forms. This is probably
partly due to the fact that
the conditions of land and
fresh-water life are not so
favourable for the spread of a species over a wide area by means
of simply-organized larvae as are those of marine life, and partly
to the fact that, in the case of fresh-water forms at any rate, a
feebly-swimming larva would be in danger of being swept out to
sea by currents.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>1. The association of larvae with small eggs. This is a true statement
as far as it goes, but in some cases small eggs do not give rise to
larvae, some special form of nutriment being provided by the parent,
<i>e.g.</i> Mammalia, in which there is a uterine nutrition by means of a
placenta; some Gastropoda (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Helix waltoni</i>, <i>Bulimus</i>), in which,
though the ovum is not specially large, it floats in a large quantity
of albumen at the expense of which the development is completed;
some Lamellibranchiata (<i>Cyclas</i>, &amp;c.), Echinodermata (many
<i>Ophiurids</i>, &amp;c.), &amp;c., in which development takes place in a brood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>228</span>
pouch. In the majority of cases, however, in which there is a small
amount of food yolk and no special arrangements for parental care,
a larva is formed. No better group than the Mollusca can be taken
to illustrate this point, for in them we find every kind of development
from the completely embryonic development of the Cephalopoda,
with their large heavily-yolked eggs, to the development of
most marine Lamellibranchiata and many Gastropoda, in which the
embryonic period is short and there is a long larval development.
The Mollusca are further specially interesting for showing very
clearly cases in which, though the young are born or hatched fully
developed, the larval stages are passed through in the egg, and the
larval organs (<i>e.g.</i> velum) are developed but without function (<i>e.g.</i>
<i>Paludina</i>, <i>Cyclas</i>, <i>Onchidium</i>). As already mentioned, the larval
form of the Mollusca is the trochosphere.</p>

<p>2. Free-swimming larvae are usually formed when the adult is
fixed. We need only refer to the cases of the Cirripedia with their
well-marked nauplius and cypris larvae, to <i>Phoronis</i> with its remarkable
<i>actinotrocha</i>, to the Crinoidea, Polyzoa, &amp;c. There are a
few exceptions to this rule, <i>e.g.</i> the Molgulidae amongst the fixed
Tunicata, <i>Tubularia</i>, <i>Myriothela</i>, &amp;c., among the Hydrozoa.</p>

<p>3. Internal parasites generally have a stage which may be called
larval, in which they are transferred either by active or passive
migration to a new host. In most Nematoda, some Cestoda, and in
Trematoda this larva leads a free life; but in some nematodes
(<i>Trichina</i>) and some cestodes the larva does not become free.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LARYNGITIS,<a name="ar198" id="ar198"></a></span> an inflammation of the mucus of the <i>larynx</i>.
There are three chief varieties: <i>acute</i>, <i>chronic</i>, and <i>oedematous</i>.
The larynx is also liable to attacks of inflammation in connexion
with tubercle or syphilis.</p>

<p><i>Acute Laryngitis</i> may be produced by an independent catarrh,
or by one extending either from the nasal or the bronchial mucous
membrane into that of the larynx. The causes are various,
&ldquo;catching cold&rdquo; being the most common. Excessive use of the
voice either in speaking or singing sometimes gives rise to it.
The inhalation of irritating particles, vapours, &amp;c., and swallowing
very hot fluids or corrosive poisons are well-recognized causes.
It may also occur in connexion with diseases, notably measles
and influenza. As a result of the inflammation there is a general
swelling of the parts about the larynx and the epiglottis, the
result being a narrowing of the channel for the entrance of the
air, and to this the chief dangers are due. The symptoms vary
with the intensity of the attack; there is first a sense of tickling,
then of heat, dryness, and pain in the throat, with some difficulty
in swallowing. There is a dry cough, with expectoration later;
phonation becomes painful, while the voice is husky, and may
be completely lost. In children there is some dyspnoea. In
favourable cases, which form the majority, the attack tends to
abate in a few days, but the inflammation may become of the
oedematous variety, and death may occur suddenly from an
asphyxial paroxysm. Many cases of acute laryngitis are so
slight as to make themselves known only by hoarseness and the
character of the cough, nevertheless in every instance the
attack demands serious attention. The diagnosis is not, in
adults, a matter of much difficulty, especially if an examination
is made with the laryngoscope; in children, however, it is more
difficult, and the question of diphtheria must not be lost sight
of. The treatment is, first and foremost, rest; no talking must
be allowed. The patient should be kept in bed, in a room at an
even temperature, and the air saturated with moisture. An
ice-bag round the throat gives much relief, while internally
diaphoretics may be given, and a full dose of Dover&rsquo;s powder
if there be much pain or cough.</p>

<p><i>Chronic Laryngitis</i> usually occurs as a result of repeated
attacks of the acute form. It is extremely common in people
who habitually over-use the voice, and is the cause of the hoarse
voice one associates with street sellers. The constant inhalation
of irritating vapours, such as tobacco smoke, may also cause it.
There is usually little or no pain, only the unpleasant sensation
of tickling in the larynx, with a constant desire to cough. The
changes in the mucous membrane are more permanent than in
the acute variety, and there nearly always accompanies this a
chronic alteration of the membrane of the pharynx (<i>granular
pharyngitis</i>). The treatment consists in stopping the cause,
where known, <i>e.g.</i> the smoking or shouting. Careful examination
should be made to see if there is any nasal obstruction, and the
larynx should be treated locally with suitable astringents,
by means of a brush, spray or insufflation. Overheated and
ill-ventilated rooms must be avoided, as entrance into them
immediately aggravates the trouble and causes a paroxysm of
coughing.</p>

<p><i>Oedematous Laryngitis</i> is a very fatal condition, which may
occur, though rarely, as a sequence of acute laryngitis. It
is far more commonly seen in syphilitic and tubercular conditions
of the larynx, in kidney disease, in certain fevers, and
in cases of cellulitis of the neck. The larynx is also one of the
sites of <i>Angeioneurotic oedema</i>. In this form of laryngitis
there are all the symptoms of acute laryngitis, but on a very
much exaggerated scale. The dyspnoea, accompanied by
marked stridor, may arise and reach a dangerous condition within
the space of an hour, and demand the most prompt treatment.
On examination the mucous membrane round the epiglottis is
seen to be enormously swollen. The treatment is ice round the
throat and internally, scarification of the swollen parts, and
should that not relieve the asphyxial symptoms, tracheotomy
must be performed immediately.</p>

<p><i>Tubercular Laryngitis</i> is practically always associated with
phthisis. The mucous membrane is invaded by the tubercles,
which first form small masses. These later break down and
ulcerate; the ulceration then spreads up and down, causing an
immense amount of destruction. The first indication is hoarseness,
or, in certain forms, pain on swallowing. The cough is,
as a rule, a late symptom. A sudden oedema may bring about
a rapid fatal termination. The general treatment is the same
as that advised for phthisis; locally, the affected parts may
be removed by one or a series of operations, generally under
local anaesthesia, or they may be treated with some destructive
agent such as lactic acid. The pain on swallowing can be best
alleviated by painting with a weak solution of cocaine. The
condition is a very grave one; the prognosis depends largely
on the associated pulmonary infection&mdash;if that be extensive, a
very small amount of laryngeal mischief resists treatment,
while, if the case be the contrary, a very extensive mischief
may be successfully dealt with.</p>

<p><i>Syphilitic Laryngitis.</i>&mdash;Invasion of the larynx in syphilis is
very common. It may occur in both stages of the disease and
in the inherited form. In the secondary stage the damage is
superficial, and the symptoms those of a slight acute laryngitis.
The injury in the tertiary stage is much more serious, the deeper
structures are invaded with the formation of deep ulcers, which
may when they heal form strong cicatrices, which produce
a narrowing of the air-passage which may eventually require
surgical interference. Occasionally a fatal oedema may arise.
The treatment consists of administering constitutional remedies,
local treatment being of comparatively slight importance.</p>

<p><i>Paroxysmal Laryngitis</i>, or <i>Laryngismus stridulus</i>, is a nervous
affection of the larynx that occurs in infants. It appears to
be associated with adenoids. The disease consists of a reflex
spasm of the glottis, which causes a complete blocking of the air-passages.
The attacks, which are recurrent, cause acute asphyxiation.
They may cease for no obvious reason, or one may prove
fatal. The whole attack is of such short duration that the
infant has either recovered or succumbed before assistance can
be called. After an attack, careful examination should be made,
and the adenoids, if present, removed by operation.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA SABLIÈRE, MARGUERITE DE<a name="ar199" id="ar199"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1640-1693), friend and
patron of La Fontaine, was the wife of Antoine Rambouillet,
sieur de la Sablière (1624-1679), a Protestant financier entrusted
with the administration of the royal estates, her maiden name
being Marguerite Hessein. She received an excellent education
in Latin, mathematics, physics and anatomy from the best
scholars of her time, and her house became a meeting-place for
poets, scientists and men of letters, no less than for brilliant
members of the court of Louis XIV. About 1673 Mme de la
Sablière received into her house La Fontaine, whom for twenty
years she relieved of every kind of material anxiety. Another
friend and inmate of the house was the traveller and physician
François Bernier, whose abridgment of the works of Gassendi
was written for Mme de la Sablière. The abbé Chaulieu and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>229</span>
his fellow-poet, Charles Auguste, marquis de La Fare, were among
her most intimate associates. La Fare sold his commission in the
army to be able to spend his time with her. This liaison, which
seems to have been the only serious passion of her life, was broken
in 1679. La Fare was seduced from his allegiance, according to
Mme de Sévigné by his love of play, but to this must be added
a new passion for the actress La Champmeslé. Mme de la
Sablière thenceforward gave more and more attention to good
works, much of her time being spent in the hospital for incurables.
Her husband&rsquo;s death in the same year increased her
serious tendencies, and she was presently converted to Roman
Catholicism. She died in Paris on the 8th of January 1693.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LA SALE<a name="ar200" id="ar200"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">La Salle</span>), <span class="bold">ANTOINE DE</span> (<i>c.</i> 1388-1462?),
French writer, was born in Provence, probably at Arles. He was
a natural son of Bernard de la Salle,<a name="fa1p" id="fa1p" href="#ft1p"><span class="sp">1</span></a> a famous soldier of fortune,
who served many masters, among others the Angevin dukes.
In 1402 Antoine entered the court of Anjou, probably as a page,
and in 1407 he was at Messina with Duke Louis II., who had
gone there to enforce his claim to the kingdom of Sicily. The
next years he perhaps spent in Brabant, for he was present at two
tournaments given at Brussels and Ghent. With other gentlemen
from Brabant, whose names he has preserved, he took part
in the expedition of 1415 against the Moors, organized by John I.
of Portugal. In 1420 he accompanied Louis III. on another
expedition to Naples, making in that year an excursion from
Norcia to the Monte della Sibilla, and the neighbouring Lake of
Pilate. The story of his adventures on this occasion, and an
account, with some sceptical comments, of the local legends
regarding Pilate, and the Sibyl&rsquo;s grotto,<a name="fa2p" id="fa2p" href="#ft2p"><span class="sp">2</span></a> form the most interesting
chapter of <i>La Salade</i>, which is further adorned with a map of
the ascent from Montemonaco. La Sale probably returned with
Louis III. of Anjou, who was also comte de Provence, in 1426
to Provence, where he was acting as <i>viguier</i> of Aries in 1429. In
1434 René, Louis&rsquo;s successor, made La Sale tutor to his son
Jean d&rsquo;Anjou, duc de Calabre, to whom he dedicated, between
the years 1438 and 1447, his <i>La Salade</i>, which is a text-book
of the studies necessary for a prince. The primary intention
of the title is no doubt the play on his own name, but he explains
it on the ground of the miscellaneous character of the book&mdash;a
salad is composed &ldquo;of many good herbs.&rdquo; In 1439 he was
again in Italy in charge of the castle of Capua, with the duc de
Calabre and his young wife, Marie de Bourbon, when the
place was besieged by the king of Aragon. René abandoned
Naples in 1442, and Antoine no doubt returned to France about
the same time. His advice was sought at the tournaments which
celebrated the marriage of the unfortunate Margaret of Anjou
at Nancy in 1445; and in 1446, at a similar display at Saumur, he
was one of the umpires. La Sale&rsquo;s pupil was now twenty years
of age, and, after forty years&rsquo; service of the house of Anjou,
La Sale left it to become tutor to the sons of Louis de Luxembourg,
comte de Saint Pol, who took him to Flanders and
presented him at the court of Philippe le Bon, duke of Burgundy.
For his new pupils he wrote at Châtelet-sur-Oise, in 1451, a
moral work entitled <i>La Salle</i>.</p>

<p>He was nearly seventy years of age when he wrote the work
that has made him famous, <i>L&rsquo;Hystoire et plaisante cronicque
du petit Jehan de Saintré et de la jeune dame des Belles-Cousines,
Sans autre nom nommer</i>, dedicated to his former pupil, Jean
de Calabre. An <i>envoi</i> in MS. 10,057 (nouv. acq. fr.) in the
Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, states that it was completed at
Châtelet on the 6th of March 1455 (<i>i.e.</i> 1456). La Sale also
announces an intention, never fulfilled, apparently, of writing
a romance of <i>Paris et Vienne</i>. The MSS. of <i>Petit Jehan de
Saintré</i> usually contain in addition <i>Floridam et Elvide</i>, translated
by Rasse de Brunhamel from the Latin of Nicolas de Clamange,
and dedicated to La Sale; also <i>Addiction extraite des Cronicques
de Flandres</i>, of which only a few lines are original. Brunhamel
says in his dedication that La Sale had delighted to write honourable
histories from the time of his &ldquo;florie jeunesse,&rdquo; which
confirms a reasonable inference from the style of <i>Petit Jehan
de Saintré</i> that its author was no novice in the art of romance-writing.
The <i>Réconfort à Madame de Neufville</i>, a consolatory
epistle including two stories of parental fortitude, was written
at Vendeuil-sur-Oise about 1458, and in 1459 La Sale produced
his treatise <i>Des anciens tournois et faictz d&rsquo;armes</i> and the <i>Journée
d&rsquo;Onneur et de Prouesse</i>. He followed his patron to Genappe
in Brabant when the Dauphin (afterwards Louis XI.) took
refuge at the Burgundian court.</p>

<p>La Sale is generally accepted as the author of one of the most
famous satires in the French language, <i>Les Quinze Joyes de
mariage</i>, because his name has been disengaged from an acrostic
at the end of the Rouen MS. He is also supposed to have been
the &ldquo;acteur&rdquo; in the collection of licentious stories supposed to
be narrated by various persons at the court of Philippe le Bon,
and entitled the <i>Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles</i>. One only of the stories
is given in his name, but he is credited with the compilation of
the whole, for which Louis XI. was long held responsible. A
completed copy of this was presented to the Duke of Burgundy
at Dijon in 1462. If then La Sale was the author, he probably
was still living; otherwise the last mention of him is in 1461.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Petit Jehan de Saintré</i> gives, at the point when the traditions of
chivalry were fast disappearing, an account of the education of an
ideal knight and rules for his conduct under many different circumstances.
When Petit Jehan, aged thirteen, is persuaded by the
Dame des Belles-Cousines to accept her as his lady, she gives him
systematic instruction in religion, courtesy, chivalry and the arts of
success. She materially advances his career until Saintré becomes
an accomplished knight, the fame of whose prowess spreads throughout
Europe. This section of the romance&mdash;apparently didactic in
intention&mdash;fits in with the author&rsquo;s other works of edification. But
in the second part this virtuous lady falls a victim to a vulgar intrigue
with Damp Abbé. One of La Sale&rsquo;s commentators, M. Joseph Nève,
ingeniously maintains that the last section is simply to show how the
hero, after passing through the other grades of education, learns at
last by experience to arm himself against coquetry. The book may,
however, be fairly regarded as satirizing the whole theory of
&ldquo;courteous&rdquo; love, by the simple method of fastening a repulsive
conclusion on an ideal case. The contention that the <i>fabliau</i>-like
ending of a romance begun in idyllic fashion was due to the corrupt
influences of the Dauphin&rsquo;s exiled court, is inadmissible, for the last
page was written when the prince arrived in Brabant in 1456. That
it is an anti-clerical satire seems unlikely. The profession of the
seducer is not necessarily chosen from that point of view. The
language of the book is not disfigured by coarseness of any kind, but,
if the brutal ending was the expression of the writer&rsquo;s real views,
there is little difficulty in accepting him as the author of the <i>Quinze
Joyes de mariage</i> and the <i>Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles</i>.&mdash;Both these are
masterpieces in their way and exhibit a much greater dramatic
power and grasp of dialogue than does <i>Petit Jehan</i>. Some light is
thrown on the romance by the circumstances of the duc de Calabre,
to whom it was dedicated. His wife, Marie de Bourbon, was one of
the &ldquo;Belles-Cousines&rdquo; who contended for the favour of Jacques or
Jacquet de Lalaing in the <i>Livre des faits de Jacques Lalaing</i> which
forms the chief source of the early exploits of Petit Jehan.</p>

<p>The incongruities of La Sale&rsquo;s aims appear in his method of construction.
The hero is not imaginary. Jehan de Saintré flourished
in the Hundred Years&rsquo; War, was taken prisoner after Poitiers, with
the elder Boucicaut, and was employed in negotiating the treaty of
Bretigny. Froissart mentioned him as &ldquo;le meilleur et le plus vaillant
chevalier de France.&rdquo; His exploits as related in the romance are,
however, founded on those of Jacques de Lalaing (<i>c.</i> 1422-1453),
who was brought up at the Burgundian court, and became such a
famous knight that he excited the rivalry of the &ldquo;Belles-Cousines,&rdquo;
Marie de Bourbon and Marie de Clèves, duchesse d&rsquo;Orléans. Lalaing&rsquo;s
exploits are related by more than one chronicler, but M. Gustave
Raynaud thinks that the <i>Livre des faits de Jacques de Lalaing</i>,
published among the works of Georges Chastelain, to which textual
parallels may be found in <i>Petit Jehan</i>, should also be attributed to
La Sale, who in that case undertook two accounts of the same hero,
one historical and the other fictitious. To complicate matters, he
drew, for the later exploits of Petit Jehan, on the <i>Livres des faits de
Jean Boucicaut</i>, which gives the history of the younger Boucicaut.
The atmosphere of the book is not the rough realities of the English
wars in which the real Saintré figured but that of the courts to which
La Sale was accustomed.</p>

<p>The title of <i>Les Quinze Joyes de mariage</i> is, with a profanity characteristic
of the time, borrowed from a popular litany, <i>Les Quinze
Joies de Notre Dame</i>, and each chapter terminates with a liturgical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>230</span>
refrain voicing the miseries of marriage. Evidence in favour of
La Sale&rsquo;s authorship is brought forward by M. E. Gossart (<i>Bibliophile
belge</i>, 1871, pp. 83-7), who quotes from his didactic treatise of <i>La
Salle</i> a passage paraphrased from St Jerome&rsquo;s treatise against
Jovinian which contains the chief elements of the satire. Gaston
Paris (<i>Revue de Paris</i>, Dec. 1897) expressed an opinion that to find
anything like the malicious penetration by which La Sale divines
the most intimate details of married life, and the painful exactness
of the description, it is necessary to travel as far as Balzac. The
theme itself was common enough in the middle ages in France, but
the dialogue of the <i>Quinze Joyes</i> is unusually natural and pregnant.
Each of the fifteen vignettes is perfect in its kind. There is no redundance.
The diffuseness of romance is replaced by the methods
of the writers of the <i>fabliaux</i>.</p>

<p>In the <i>Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles</i> the Italian <i>novella</i> is naturalized in
France. The book is modelled on the <i>Decameron</i> of Boccaccio, and
owes something to the Latin <i>Facetiae</i> of the contemporary scholar
Poggio; but the stories are rarely borrowed, and in cases where the
<i>Nouvelles</i> have Italian parallels they appear to be independent
variants. In most cases the general immorality of the conception is
matched by the grossness of the details, but the ninety-eighth story
narrates what appears to be a genuine tragedy, and is of an entirely
different nature from the other <i>contes</i>. It is another version of the
story of Floridam et Elvide already mentioned.</p>

<p>Not content with allowing these achievements to La Sale, some
critics have proposed to ascribe to him also the farce of <i>Maître
Pathelin</i>.</p>

<p>The best editions of La Sale&rsquo;s undoubted and reputed works are:&mdash;<i>Petit
Jehan de Saintré</i> by J. M. Guichard (1843); <i>Les Cent Nouvelles
Nouvelles</i> by Thomas Wright (Bibl. elzévérienne, 1858); <i>Les Quinze
Joyes de mariage</i> by P. Jannet (Bibl. elzév., 1857). <i>La Salade</i> was
printed more than once during the 16th century. <i>La Salle</i> was never
printed. For its contents see E. Gossart in the <i>Bibliophile belge</i>

<p><span class="bold">LASALLE, ANTOINE CHEVALIER LOUIS COLLINET,<a name="ar201" id="ar201"></a></span>
<span class="sc">Count</span> (1775-1809), French soldier, belonged to a noble family
in Lorraine. His grandfather was Abraham Fabert, marshal
of France. Entering the French army at the age of eleven,
he had reached the rank of lieutenant when the Revolution
broke out. As an aristocrat, he lost his commission, but he
enlisted in the ranks, where his desperate bravery and innate
power of command soon distinguished him. By 1795 he had
won back his grade, and was serving as a staff-officer in the army
of Italy. On one occasion, at Vicenza, he rivalled Seydlitz&rsquo;s
feat of leaping his horse over the parapet of a bridge to avoid
capture, and, later, in Egypt, he saved Davout&rsquo;s life in action.
By 1800 he had become colonel, and in one combat in that year
he had two horses killed under him, and broke seven swords.
Five years later, having attained the rank of general of brigade,
he was present with his brigade of light cavalry at Austerlitz.
In the pursuit after Jena in 1806, though he had but 600 hussars
and not one piece of artillery with him, he terrified the commandant
of the strong fortress of Stettin into surrender, a feat
rarely equalled save by that of Cromwell on Bletchingdon House.
Made general of division for this exploit, he was next in the Polish
campaign, and at Heilsberg saved the life of Murat, grand
duke of Berg. When the Peninsular War began, Lasalle was
sent out with one of the cavalry divisions, and at Medina de
Rio Seco, Gamonal and Medellin broke every body of troops
which he charged. A year later, at the head of one of the cavalry
divisions of the <i>Grande Armée</i> he took part in the Austrian war.
At Wagram he was killed at the head of his men. With the
possible exception of Curély, who was in 1809 still unknown,
Napoleon never possessed a better leader of light horse. Wild
and irregular in his private life, Lasalle was far more than
a <i>beau sabreur</i>. To talent and experience he added that
power of feeling the pulse of the battle which is the true gift
of a great leader. A statue of him was erected in Lunéville in
1893. His remains were brought from Austria to the Invalides
in 1891.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA SALLE, RENÉ ROBERT CAVELIER,<a name="ar202" id="ar202"></a></span> <span class="sc">Sieur de</span> (1643-1687),
French explorer in North America, was born at Rouen
on the 22nd of November 1643. He taught for a time in a school
(probably Jesuit) in France, and seems to have forfeited his
claim to his father&rsquo;s estate by his connexion with the Jesuits.
In 1666 he became a settler in Canada, whither his brother, a
Sulpician abbé, had preceded him. From the Seminary of St
Sulpice in Montreal La Salle received a grant on the St Lawrence
about 8 m. above Montreal, where he built a stockade and
established a fur-trading post. In 1669 he sold this post (partly
to the Sulpicians who had granted it to him) to raise funds for
an expedition to China<a name="fa1q" id="fa1q" href="#ft1q"><span class="sp">1</span></a> by way of the Ohio,<a name="fa2q" id="fa2q" href="#ft2q"><span class="sp">2</span></a> which he supposed,
from the reports of the Indians, to flow into the Pacific. He
passed up the St Lawrence and through Lake Ontario to a
Seneca village on the Genesee river; thence with an Iroquois
guide he crossed the mouth of the Niagara (where he heard the
noise of the distant falls) to Ganastogue, an Iroquois colony
at the head of Lake Ontario, where he met Louis Joliet and
received from him a map of parts of the Great Lakes. La Salle&rsquo;s
missionary comrades now gave up the quest for China to preach
among the Indians. La Salle discovered the Ohio river, descended
it at least as far as the site of Louisville, Kentucky, and possibly,
though not probably, to its junction with the Mississippi, and
in 1669-1670, abandoned by his few followers, made his way
back to Lake Erie. Apparently he passed through Lake Erie,
Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, and some way down the Illinois
river. Little is known of these explorations, for his journals
are lost, and the description of his travels rests only on the
testimony of the anonymous author of a <i>Histoire de M. de la
Salle</i>. Before 1673 La Salle had returned to Montreal. Becoming
convinced, after the explorations of Marquette and Joliet in
1673, that the Mississippi flowed into the Gulf of Mexico, he
conceived a vast project for exploring that river to its mouth
and extending the French power to the lower Mississippi Valley.
He secured the support of Count Frontenac, then governor of
Canada, and in 1674 and 1677 visited France, obtaining from
Louis XIV. on his first visit a patent of nobility and a grant of
lands about Fort Frontenac, on the site of the present Kingston,
Ontario, and on his second visit a patent empowering him to
explore the West at his own expense, and giving him the buffalo-hide
monopoly. Late in the year 1678, at the head of a small
party, he started from Fort Frontenac. He established a post
above Niagara Falls, where he spent the winter, and where,
his vessel having been wrecked, he built a larger ship, the
&ldquo;Griffon,&rdquo; in which he sailed up the Great Lakes to Green Bay
(Lake Michigan), where he arrived in September 1679. Sending
back the &ldquo;Griffon&rdquo; freighted with furs, by which he hoped to
satisfy the claims of his creditors, he proceeded to the Illinois
river, and near what is now Peoria, Illinois, built a fort, which
he called Fort Crèvec&oelig;ur. Thence he detached Father Hennepin,
with one companion, to explore the Illinois to its mouth, and,
leaving his lieutenant, Henri de Tonty (<i>c.</i> 1650-<i>c.</i> 1702),<a name="fa3q" id="fa3q" href="#ft3q"><span class="sp">3</span></a> with
about fifteen men, at Fort Crèvec&oelig;ur, he returned by land,
afoot, to Canada to obtain needed supplies, discovering the fate
of the &ldquo;Griffon&rdquo; (which proved to have been lost), thwarting
the intrigues of his enemies and appeasing his creditors. In
July 1680 news reached him at Fort Frontenac that nearly
all Tonty&rsquo;s men had deserted, after destroying or appropriating
most of the supplies; and that twelve of them were on their
way to kill him as the surest means of escaping punishment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>231</span>
These he met and captured or killed. He then returned to the
Illinois, to find the country devastated by the Iroquois, and
his post abandoned. He formed a league of the Western Indians
to fight the Iroquois, then went to Michilimackinac, where he
found Tonty, proceeded again to Fort Frontenac to obtain
supplies and organize his expedition anew, and returned in
December 1681 to the Illinois. Passing down the Illinois to
the Mississippi, which he reached in February 1682, he floated
down that stream to its mouth, which he reached on the 9th
of April, and, erecting there a monument and a cross, took
formal possession in the name of Louis XIV., in whose honour
he gave the name &ldquo;Louisiana&rdquo; to the region. He then returned
to Michilimackinac, whence, with Tonty, he went again to the
Illinois and established a fort, Fort St Louis, probably on
Starved Rock (near the present Ottawa, Illinois), around which
nearly 20,000 Indians (Illinois, Miamis and others seeking
protection from the Iroquois) had been gathered. La Salle
then went to Quebec, and La Barre, who had succeeded
Frontenac, being unfriendly to him, again visited France (1684),
where he succeeded in interesting the king in a scheme to establish
a fort at the mouth of the Mississippi and to seize the Spanish
posts in the vicinity. On the 24th of July 1684, with four
vessels under the command of himself and Captain Beaujeu,
a naval officer, he sailed from La Rochelle. Mistaking, it appears,
the inlets of Matagorda Bay (which La Salle called St Louis&rsquo;s
Bay) in the present state of Texas, for the mouth of an arm of
the Mississippi, he landed there, and Beaujeu, soon afterwards
returned to France. The expedition had met with various
misfortunes; one vessel had been captured by the Spaniards
and another had been wrecked; and throughout La Salle and
Beaujeu had failed to work in harmony. Soon finding that he
was not at the mouth of the Mississippi, La Salle established a
settlement and built a fort, Fort St Louis, on the Lavaca (he
called it La Vache) river, and leaving there the greater part of
his force, from October 1685 to March 1686 he vainly sought
for the Mississippi. He also made two attempts to reach the
Illinois country and Canada, and during the second, after two
months of fruitless wanderings, he was assassinated, on the
19th of March 1687, by several of his followers, near the Trinity
river in the present Texas.</p>

<p>His colony on the Lavaca, after suffering terribly from privation
and disease and being attacked by the Indians, was finally
broken up, and a force of Spaniards sent against it in 1689 found
nothing but dead bodies and a dismantled fort; the few survivors
having become domesticated in the Indian villages
near by. Some writers, notably J. G. Shea, maintain that La
Salle never intended to fortify the mouth of the Mississippi,
but was instructed to establish an advanced post near the
Spanish possessions, where he was to await a powerful expedition
under a renegade Spaniard, Peñalosa, with whom he was
to co-operate in expelling the Spaniards from this part of the
continent.<a name="fa4q" id="fa4q" href="#ft4q"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p>La Salle was one of the greatest of the explorers in North
America. Besides discovering the Ohio and probably the
Illinois, he was the first to follow the Mississippi from its upper
course to its mouth and thus to establish the connexion between
the discoveries of Radisson, Joliet and Marquette in the north
with those of De Soto in the south. He was stern, indomitable
and full of resource.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA SALLE, ST JEAN BAPTISTE DE<a name="ar203" id="ar203"></a></span> (1651-1719), founder
of the order of Christian Brothers, was born at Reims. The
son of a rich lawyer, his father&rsquo;s influence early secured him
a canonry in the cathedral; there he established a school,
where free elementary instruction was given to poor children.
The enterprise soon broadened in scope; a band of enthusiastic
assistants gathered round him; he resolved to resign his canonry,
and devote himself entirely to education. His assistants were
organized into a community, which gradually rooted itself all
over France; and a training-school for teachers, the Collège
de Saint-Yon, was set up at Rouen. In 1725, six years after
the founder&rsquo;s death, the society was recognized by the pope,
under the official title of &ldquo;Brothers of the Christian Schools&rdquo;;
its members took the usual monastic vows, but did not aspire
to the priesthood. During the first hundred years of its existence
its activities were mainly confined to France; during the 19th
century it spread to most of the countries of western Europe,
and has been markedly successful in the United States. When
La Salle was canonized in 1900, the total number of brothers
was estimated at 15,000. Although the order has been chiefly
concerned with elementary schools, it undertakes most branches
of secondary and technical education; and it has served as a
model for other societies, in Ireland and elsewhere, slightly
differing in character from the original institute.</p>

seem to have been applied by the Portuguese, first to an inferior
class of men in military service (cf. &ldquo;gun-lascars&rdquo;), and then
to sailors as early as the 17th century. The form <i>askari</i> on the
east coast of Africa, equivalent to &ldquo;sepoy,&rdquo; comes from the
Arabic &lsquo;<i>askar</i> = army, which is believed to be itself taken from
the Persian.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LASCARIS, CONSTANTINE<a name="ar207" id="ar207"></a></span> (d. 1493 or 1500), Greek scholar
and grammarian, one of the promoters of the revival of Greek
learning in Italy, was born at Constantinople. He was a member
of the noble Bithynian family, which had furnished three emperors
of Nicaea during the 13th century. After the fall of
Constantinople in 1453, he took refuge first in Corfu and then
in Italy, where Francesco Sforza, duke of Milan, appointed
him Greek tutor to his daughter. Here was published his
<i>Grammatica Graeca, sive compendium octo orationis partium</i>,
remarkable as being the first book entirely in Greek issued
from the printing press. After leaving Milan, Lascaris taught
in Rome under the patronage of Cardinal Bessarion, and in
Naples, whither he had been summoned by Ferdinand I. to
deliver a course of lectures on Greece. Ultimately, on the
invitation of the inhabitants, he settled in Messina, Sicily, where
he continued to teach publicly until his death. Among his
numerous pupils here was Pietro Bembo. Lascaris bequeathed
his library of valuable MSS. to the senate of Messina; the
collection was afterwards carried to Spain and lodged in the
Escurial.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The <i>Grammatica</i>, which has often been reprinted, is the only work
of value produced by Lascaris. Some of his letters are given by
J. Iriarte in the <i>Regiae Bibliothecae Matritensis codices Graeci manuscripti</i>,
i. (Madrid, 1769). His name is known to modern readers in
the romance of A. F. Villemain, <i>Lascaris, ou les Grecs du quinzième
siècle</i> (1825). See also J. E. Sandys, <i>Hist. Class. Schol.</i>, ed. 2, vol. ii.

Greek scholar, probably the younger brother of Constantine
Lascaris, surnamed Rhyndacenus from the river Rhyndacus
in Bithynia, his native province. After the fall of Constantinople
he was taken to the Peloponnese, thence to Crete, and ultimately
found refuge in Florence at the court of Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici,
whose intermediary he was with the sultan Bayezid II. in
the purchase of Greek MSS. for the Medicean library. On
the expulsion of the Medici from Florence, at the invitation
of Charles VIII. of France, Lascaris removed to Paris (1495),
where he gave public instruction in Greek. By Louis XII.
he was several times employed on public missions, amongst
others to Venice (1503-1508), and in 1515 he appears to have
accepted the invitation of Leo X. to take charge of the Greek
college he had founded at Rome. We afterwards (1518) find
Lascaris employed along with Budaeus (Budé) by Francis I.
in the formation of the royal library at Fontainebleau, and also
again sent in the service of the French crown to Venice. He
died at Rome, whither he had been summoned by Pope Paul
III., in 1535. Among his pupils was Musurus.</p>

<p>Amongst other works, Lascaris edited or wrote: <i>Anthologia
epigrammatum Graecorum</i> (1494), in which he ascribed the collection
of the Anthology to Agathias, not to Planudes; <i>Didymi Alexandrini

<p><span class="bold">LAS CASAS, BARTOLOMÉ DE<a name="ar209" id="ar209"></a></span> (1474-1566), for some time
bishop of Chiapa in Mexico, and known to posterity as &ldquo;The
Apostle of the Indies,&rdquo; was a native of Seville. His father,
one of the companions of Columbus in the voyage which resulted
in the discovery of the New World, sent him to Salamanca,
where he graduated. In 1498 he accompanied his father in
an expedition under Columbus to the West Indies, and in 1502
he went with Nicolás de Ovando, the governor, to Hayti, where
in 1510 he was admitted to holy orders, being the first priest
ordained in the American colonies. In 1511 he passed over
to Cuba to take part in the work of &ldquo;population and pacification,&rdquo;
and in 1513 or 1514 he witnessed and vainly endeavoured
to check the massacre of Indians at Caonao. Soon afterwards
there was assigned to him and his friend Renteria a large village
in the neighbourhood of Zagua, with a number of Indians attached
to it in what was known as <i>repartimiento</i> (allotment); like the
rest of his countrymen he made the most of this opportunity
for growing rich, but occasionally celebrated mass and preached.
Soon, however, having become convinced of the injustice connected
with the <i>repartimiento</i> system, he began to preach against
it, at the same time giving up his own slaves. With the consent
of his partner he resolved to go to Spain on behalf of the oppressed
natives, and the result of his representations was that
in 1516 Cardinal Jimenes caused a commission to be sent out
for the reform of abuses, Las Casas himself, with the title of
&ldquo;protector of the Indians,&rdquo; being appointed to advise and
report on them. This commission had not been long at San
Domingo before Las Casas perceived the indifference of his
coadjutors to the cause which he himself had at heart, and
July 1517 found him again in Spain, where he developed his
scheme for the complete liberation of the Indians&mdash;a scheme
which not only included facilities for emigration from Spain,
but was intended to give to each Spanish resident in the colonies
the right of importing twelve negro slaves. The emigration
movement proved a failure, and Las Casas lived long enough
to express his shame for having been so slow to see that Africans
were as much entitled to freedom as were the natives of the
New World. Overwhelmed with disappointment, he retired
to the Dominican monastery in Haiti; he joined the order in
1522 and devoted eight years to study. About 1530 he appears
to have revisited the Spanish court, but on what precise errand
is not known; the confusion concerning this period of his life
extends to the time when, after visits to Mexico, Nicaragua,
Peru and Guatemala, he undertook an expedition in 1537 into
Tuzulutlan, the inhabitants of which were, chiefly through
his tact, peaceably converted to Christianity, mass being celebrated
for the first time amongst them in the newly founded
town of Rabinal in 1538. In 1539 Las Casas was sent to Spain
to obtain Dominican recruits, and through Loaysa, general
of the order, and confessor of Charles V., he was successful
in obtaining royal orders and letters favouring his enterprise.
During this stay in Europe, which lasted more than four years,
he visited Germany to see the emperor; he also (1542) wrote
his <i>Veynte Razones</i>, in defence of the liberties of the Indians
and the <i>Brevisima Relacion de la Destruycion des las Indias
occidentales</i>, the latter of which was published some twelve
years later. In 1543 he refused the Mexican bishopric of Cuzco,
but was prevailed upon to accept that of Chiapa, for which he
sailed in 1544. Thwarted at every point by the officials, and
outraged by his countrymen in his attempt to carry out the
new laws which his humanity had procured, he returned to
Spain and resigned his dignity (1547). In 1550 he met Sepúlveda
in public debate on the theses drawn from the recently
published <i>Apologia pro libro de justis belli causis</i>, in which
the latter had maintained the lawfulness of waging unprovoked
war upon the natives of the New World. The course of the
discussion may be traced in the account of the <i>Disputa</i> contained
in the <i>Obras</i> (1552). In 1565 Las Casas successfully
remonstrated with Philip II. against the financial project for
selling the reversion of the <i>encomiendas</i>&mdash;a project which
would have involved the Indians in hopeless bondage. In July
of the following year he died at Madrid, whither he had gone
to urge (and with success) the necessity of restoring a court
of justice which had been suppressed in Guatemala. His
<i>Historia de las Indias</i> was not published till 1875-1876.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAS CASES, EMMANUEL AUGUSTIN DIEUDONNÉ MARIN JOSEPH,<a name="ar210" id="ar210"></a></span>
<span class="sc">Marquis</span> (1766-1842), French official, was born at the
castle of Las Cases near Revel in Languedoc. He was educated
at the military schools of Vendôme and Paris; he entered the
navy and took part in various engagements of the years 1781-1782.
The outbreak of the Revolution in 1789 caused him to
&ldquo;emigrate,&rdquo; and he spent some years in Germany and England,
sharing in the disastrous Quiberon expedition (1795). He was
one of the few survivors and returned to London, where he lived
in poverty. He returned to France during the Consulate with
other royalists who rallied to the side of Napoleon, and stated
afterwards to the emperor that he was &ldquo;conquered by his glory.&rdquo;
Not until 1810 did he receive much notice from Napoleon, who
then made him a chamberlain and created him a count of the
empire (he was marquis by hereditary right). After the first
abdication of the emperor (11th of April 1814), Las Cases retired
to England, but returned to serve Napoleon during the Hundred
Days. The second abdication opened up for Las Cases the most
noteworthy part of his career. He withdrew with the ex-emperor
and a few other trusty followers to Rochefort; and it was Las
Cases who first proposed and strongly urged the emperor to
throw himself on the generosity of the British nation. Las Cases
made the first overtures to Captain Maitland of H.M.S. &ldquo;Bellerophon&rdquo;
and received a guarded reply, the nature of which he
afterwards misrepresented. Las Cases accompanied the ex-emperor
to St Helena and acted informally but very assiduously
as his secretary, taking down numerous notes of his conversations
which thereafter took form in the famous <i>Mémorial de Ste
Hélène</i>. The limits of this article preclude an attempt at assessing
the value of this work. It should be read with great caution,
as the compiler did not scruple to insert his own thoughts and
to colour the expressions of his master. In some cases he
misstated facts and even fabricated documents. It is far less
trustworthy than the record penned by Gourgaud in his <i>Journal</i>.
Disliked by Montholon and Gourgaud, Las Cases seems to have
sought an opportunity to leave the island when he had accumulated
sufficient literary material. However that may be, he
infringed the British regulations in such a way as to lead to his
expulsion by the governor, Sir Hudson Lowe (November, 1816).
He was sent first to the Cape of Good Hope and thence to Europe,
but was not at first allowed by the government of Louis XVIII.
to enter France. He resided at Brussels; but, gaining permission
to come to Paris after the death of Napoleon, he took
up his residence there, published the <i>Mémorial</i>, and soon gained
an enormous sum from it. He died in 1842 at Passy.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LASKER, EDUARD<a name="ar212" id="ar212"></a></span> (1829-1884), German publicist, was born
on the 14th of October 1829, at Jarotschin, a village in Posen,
being the son of a Jewish tradesman. He attended the gymnasium,
and afterwards the university of Breslau. In 1848,
after the outbreak of the revolution, he went to Vienna and
entered the students&rsquo; legion which took so prominent a part in
the disturbances; he fought against the imperial troops during
the siege of the city in October. He then continued his legal
studies at Breslau and Berlin, and after a visit of three years to
England, then the model state for German liberals, entered the
Prussian judicial service. In 1870 he left the government
service, and in 1873 was appointed to an administrative post
in the service of the city of Berlin. He had been brought to the
notice of the political world by some articles he wrote from
1861 to 1864, which were afterwards published under the title
<i>Zur Verfassungsgeschichte Preussens</i> (Leipzig, 1874), and in
1865 he was elected member for one of the divisions of Berlin
in the Prussian parliament. He joined the radical or <i>Fortschritts</i>
party, and in 1867 was also elected to the German parliament,
but he helped to form the national liberal party, and in consequence
lost his seat in Berlin, which remained faithful to the
radicals; after this he represented Magdeburg and Frankfort-on-Main
in the Prussian, and Meiningen in the German, parliament.
He threw himself with great energy into his parliamentary
duties, and quickly became one of its most popular and most
influential members. An optimist and idealist, he joined to a
fervent belief in liberty an equal enthusiasm for German unity
and the idea of the German state. His motion that Baden
should be included in the North German Confederation in
January 1870 caused much embarrassment to Bismarck, but
was not without effect in hastening the crisis of 1870. His great
work, however, was the share he took in the judicial reform
during the ten years 1867-1877. To him more than to any
other single individual is due the great codification of the law.
While he again and again was able to compel the government
to withdraw or amend proposals which seemed dangerous to
liberty, he opposed those liberals who, unable to obtain all the
concessions which they called for, refused to vote for the new
laws as a whole. A speech made by Lasker on the 7th of February
1873, in which he attacked the management of the Pomeranian
railway, caused a great sensation, and his exposure of the
financial mismanagement brought about the fall of Hermann
Wagener, one of Bismarck&rsquo;s most trusted assistants. By this
action he caused, however, some embarrassment to his party.
This is generally regarded as the beginning of the reaction
against economic liberalism by which he and his party were to
be deprived of their influence. He refused to follow Bismarck
in his financial and economic policy after 1878; always unsympathetic
to the chancellor, he was now selected for his most
bitter attacks. Between the radicals and socialists on the one
side and the government on the other, like many of his friends,
he was unable to maintain himself. In 1879 he lost his seat in
the Prussian parliament; he joined the <i>Sezession</i>, but was ill
at ease in his new position. Broken in health and spirits by the
incessant labours of the time when he did &ldquo;half the work of the
Reichstag,&rdquo; he went in 1883 for a tour in America, and died
suddenly in New York on the 5th of January 1884.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Lasker&rsquo;s death was the occasion of a curious episode, which caused
much discussion at the time. The American House of Representatives
adopted a motion of regret, and added to it these words:
&ldquo;That his loss is not alone to be mourned by the people of his
native land, where his firm and constant exposition of, and devotion
to, free and liberal ideas have materially advanced the social, political
and economic conditions of these people, but by the lovers of liberty
throughout the world.&rdquo; This motion was sent through the American
minister at Berlin to the German foreign office, with a request that it
might be communicated to the president of the Reichstag. It was
to ask Bismarck officially to communicate a resolution in which a
foreign parliament expressed an opinion in German affairs exactly
opposed to that which the emperor at his advice had always followed.
Bismarck therefore refused to communicate the resolution, and returned
it through the German minister at Washington.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LASKI,<a name="ar213" id="ar213"></a></span> the name of a noble and powerful Polish family, is
taken from the town of Lask, the seat of their lordship.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jan Laski</span>, the elder (1456-1531), Polish statesman and
ecclesiastic, appears to have been largely self-taught and to have
owed everything to the remarkable mental alertness which was
hereditary in the Laski family. He took orders betimes, and in
1495 was secretary to the Polish chancellor Zawisza Kurozwecki,
in which position he acquired both influence and experience.
The aged chancellor entrusted the sharp-witted young ecclesiastic
with the conduct of several important missions. Twice, in 1495
and again in 1500, he was sent to Rome, and once on a special
embassy to Flanders, of which he has left an account. On these
occasions he had the opportunity of displaying diplomatic talent
of a high order. On the accession to the Polish throne in 1501 of
the indolent Alexander, who had little knowledge of Polish affairs
and chiefly resided in Lithuania, Laski was appointed by the
senate the king&rsquo;s secretary, in which capacity he successfully
opposed the growing separatist tendencies of the grand-duchy
and maintained the influence of Catholicism, now seriously
threatened there by the Muscovite propaganda. So struck
was the king by his ability that on the death of the Polish
chancellor in 1503 he passed over the vice-chancellor Macics
Dzewicki and confided the great seal to Laski. As chancellor
Laski supported the <i>szlachta</i>, or country-gentlemen, against
the lower orders, going so far as to pass an edict excluding
henceforth all plebeians from the higher benefices of the church.
Nevertheless he approved himself such an excellent public
servant that the new king, Sigismund I., made him one of his
chief counsellors. In 1511 the chancellor, who ecclesiastically
was still only a canon of Cracow, obtained the coveted dignity
of archbishop of Gnesen which carried with it the primacy of
the Polish church. In the long negotiations with the restive
and semi-rebellious Teutonic Order, Laski rendered Sigismund
most important political services, proposing as a solution of the
question that Sigismund should be elected grand master, while
he, Laski, should surrender the primacy to the new candidate
of the knights, Albert of Brandenburg, a solution which would
have been far more profitable to Poland than the ultimate
settlement of 1525. In 1513 Laski was sent to the Lateran
council, convened by Pope Julius II., to plead the cause of Poland
against the knights, where both as an orator and as a diplomatist
he brilliantly distinguished himself. This mission was equally
profitable to his country and himself, and he succeeded in obtaining
from the pope for the archbishops of Gnesen the title of <i>legati
nati</i>. In his old age Laski&rsquo;s partiality for his nephew, Hieronymus,
led him to support the candidature of John Zapolya, the protégé
of the Turks, for the Hungarian crown so vehemently against
the Habsburgs that Clement VII. excommunicated him, and the
shock of this disgrace was the cause of his sudden death in 1531.
Of his numerous works the most noteworthy are his collection of
Polish statutes entitled: <i>Statuta provinciae gnesnensis antiqua, &amp;c.</i>
(Cracow, 1525-1528) and <i>De Ruthenorum nationibus eorumque
erroribus</i>, printed at Nuremberg.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="sc">Hieronymus Jaroslaw Laski</span> (1496-1542), Polish diplomatist,
nephew of Archbishop Laski, was successively palatine
of Inowroclaw and of Sieradia. His first important mission was
to Paris in 1524, ostensibly to contract an anti-Turkish league
with the French king, but really to bring about a matrimonial
alliance between the dauphin, afterwards Henry II., and the
daughter of King Sigismund I., a project which failed through
no fault of Laski&rsquo;s. The collapse of the Hungarian monarchy
at Mohacs (1526) first opened up a wider career to Laski&rsquo;s
adventurous activity. Contrary to the wishes of his own
sovereign, Sigismund I., whose pro-Austrian policy he detested,
Laski entered the service of John Zapolya, the Magyar competitor
for the Hungarian throne, thereby seriously compromising
Poland both with the emperor and the pope. Zapolya despatched
him on an embassy to Paris, Copenhagen and Munich for help,
but on his return he found his patron a refugee in Transylvania,
whither he had retired after his defeat by the German king
Ferdinand I. at Tokay in 1527. In his extremity Zapolya placed
himself under the protection of the sultan, Laski being sent to
Constantinople as his intermediary. On his way thither he was
attacked and robbed of everything, including his credentials and
the rich presents without which no negotiations were deemed
possible at the Porte. But Laski was nothing if not audacious.
Proceeding on his way to the Turkish capital empty-handed,
he nevertheless succeeded in gaining the confidence of Gritti, the
favourite of the grand vizier, and ultimately persuaded the
sultan to befriend Zapolya and to proclaim him king of Hungary.
He went still further, and without the slightest authority for his
action concluded a ten years&rsquo; truce between his old master
King Sigismund of Poland and the Porte. He then returned
to Hungary at the head of 10,000 men, with whose aid he enabled
Zapolya to re-establish his position and defeat Ferdinand at
Saros-Patak. He was rewarded with the countship of Zips
and the governor-generalship of Transylvania. But his influence
excited the jealousy of the Magyars, and Zapolya was persuaded
to imprison him. On being released by the interposition of the
Polish grand hetman, Tarnowski, he became the most violent
opponent of Zapolya. Shortly after his return to Poland,
Laski died suddenly at Cracow, probably poisoned by one of his
innumerable enemies.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jan Laski</span>, the younger (1499-1560), also known as <i>Johannes
a Lasco</i>, Polish reformer, son of Jaroslaw (d. 1523), voivode
of Sieradia and nephew of the famous Archbishop Laski. During
his academical course abroad he made the acquaintance of
Zwingli and Erasmus and returned to Poland in 1526 saturated
with the new doctrines. Nevertheless he took orders, and owing
to the influence of his uncle obtained the bishopric of Veszprem
in Hungary from King John Zapolya, besides holding a canonry
of Cracow and the office of royal secretary. In 1531 he resigned
all his benefices rather than give up a woman whom he had
secretly married, and having incurred general reprobation and
the lasting displeasure of his uncle the archbishop, he fled to
Germany, where ultimately (1543) he adopted the Augsburg
Confession. For the next thirteen years Laski was a wandering
apostle of the new doctrines. He was successively superintendent
at Emden and in Friesland, passed from thence to London where
he became a member of the so-called <i>ecclesia peregrinorum</i>, a
congregation of foreign Protestants exiled in consequence of the
Augsburg Interim of 1548 and, on being expelled by Queen
Mary, took refuge first in Denmark and subsequently at Frankfort-on-Main,
where he was greatly esteemed. From Frankfort
he addressed three letters (printed at Basel) to King Sigismund,
Augustus, and the Polish gentry and people, urging the conversion
of Poland to Protestantism. In 1556, during the brief
triumph of the anti-catholics, he returned to his native land,
took part in the synod of Brzesc, and published a number of
polemical works, the most noteworthy of which were <i>Forma
ac ratio tota ecclesiastici ministerii in peregrinorum Ecclesiae
instituta</i> (Pinczow, 1560), and in Polish, <i>History of the Cruel
Persecution of the Church of God in 1567</i>, republished in his
<i>Opera</i>, edited by A. Kuyper at Amsterdam in 1866. He died at
Pinczow in January 1560 and was buried with great pomp by
the Polish Protestants, who also struck a medal in his honour.
Twice married, he left two sons and two daughters. His nephew
(?) Albert Laski, who visited England in 1583, wasted a fortune

<p><span class="bold">LAS PALMAS,<a name="ar214" id="ar214"></a></span> the capital of the Spanish island of Grand
Canary, in the Canary archipelago, and of an administrative
district which also comprises the islands of Lanzarote and
Fuerteventura; on the east coast, in 28° 7&prime; N. and 5° 24&prime; W.
Pop. (1900) 44,517. Las Palmas is the largest city in the Canary
Islands, of which it was the capital until 1833. It is the seat of
a court of appeal, of a brigadier, who commands the military forces
in the district, of a civil lieutenant-governor, who is independent
of the governor-general except in connexion with elections and
municipal administration, and of a bishop, who is subordinate
to the archbishop of Seville. The palms from which the city
derives its name are still characteristic of the fertile valley which
it occupies. Las Palmas is built on both banks of a small river,
and although parts of it date from the 16th century, it is on the
whole a clean and modern city, well drained, and supplied with
pure water, conveyed by an aqueduct from the highlands of the
interior. Its principal buildings include a handsome cathedral,
founded in the 16th century but only completed in the 19th, a
theatre, a museum, an academy of art, and several hospitals and
good schools. The modern development of Las Palmas is largely
due to the foreign merchants, and especially to the British who
control the greater portion of the local commerce. La Luz, the
port, is connected with Las Palmas by a railway 4 m. long;
it is a free port and harbour of refuge, officially considered the
third in importance of Spanish ports, but actually the first in
the matter of tonnage. It is strongly fortified. The harbour,
protected by the promontory of La Isleta, which is connected
with the mainland by a narrow bar of sand, can accommodate
the largest ships, and affords secure anchorage in all weathers.
Ships can discharge at the breakwater (1257 yds. long) or at the
Santa Catalina mole, constructed in 1883-1902. The minimum
depth of water alongside the quays is 4½ ft. There are floating
water-tanks, numerous lighters, titan and other cranes, repairing
workshops, and very large supplies of coal afloat and ashore. La
Luz is one of the principal Atlantic coaling stations, and the coal-trade
is entirely in British hands. Other important industries
are shipbuilding, fishing, and the manufacture of glass, leather
and hats. The chief exports are fruit, vegetables, sugar, wine
and cochineal; coal, iron, cement, timber, petroleum, manure,
textiles and provisions are the chief imports. (See also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Canary

<p><span class="bold">LASSALLE, FERDINAND<a name="ar215" id="ar215"></a></span> (1825-1864), German socialist,
was born at Breslau on the 11th of April 1825, of Jewish extraction.
His father, a prosperous merchant in Breslau, intended
Ferdinand for a business career, and sent him to the commercial
school at Leipzig; but the boy got himself transferred to the
university, first at Breslau, and afterwards at Berlin. His
favourite studies were philology and philosophy; he became
an ardent Hegelian. Having completed his university studies
in 1845, he began to write a work on Heraclitus from the Hegelian
point of view; but it was soon interrupted by more stirring
interests, and did not see the light for many years. It was
in Berlin, towards the end of 1845, that he met the lady with
whom his life was to be associated in so remarkable a way, the
Countess Hatzfeldt. She had been separated from her husband
for many years, and was at feud with him on questions of
property and the custody of their children. Lassalle attached
himself to the cause of the countess, whom he believed to have
been outrageously wronged, made special study of law, and,
after bringing the case before thirty-six tribunals, reduced
the powerful count to a compromise on terms most favourable
to his client. The process, which lasted ten years, gave rise
to not a little scandal, especially that of the <i>Cassettengeschichte</i>
which pursued Lassalle all the rest of his life. This &ldquo;affair
of the casket&rdquo; arose out of an attempt by the countess&rsquo;s friends
to get possession of a bond for a large life annuity settled by
the count on his mistress, a Baroness Meyendorf, to the prejudice
of the countess and her children. Two of Lassalle&rsquo;s comrades
succeeded in carrying off the casket, which contained the lady&rsquo;s
jewels, from the baroness&rsquo;s room at an hotel in Cologne. They
were prosecuted for theft, one of them being condemned to
six months&rsquo; imprisonment. Lassalle, accused of moral complicity,
was acquitted on appeal. He was not so fortunate
in 1849, when he underwent a year&rsquo;s durance for resistance
to the authorities of Düsseldorf during the troubles of that
stormy period. But going to prison was a familiar experience
in Lassalle&rsquo;s life. Till 1859 Lassalle resided mostly in the Rhine
country, prosecuting the suit of the countess, finishing the
work on Heraclitus, which was not published till 1858, taking
little part in political agitation, but ever a helpful friend of
the working men. He was not allowed to live in Berlin because
of his connexion with the disturbances of &rsquo;48. In 1859, however,
he entered the city disguised as a carter, and, through the
influence of Humboldt with the king, got permission to stay
there. The same year he published a remarkable pamphlet
on the <i>Italian War and the Mission of Prussia</i>, in which he
warned his countrymen against going to the rescue of Austria
in her war with France. He pointed out that if France drove
Austria out of Italy she might annex Savoy, but could not prevent
the restoration of Italian unity under Victor Emmanuel. France
was doing the work of Germany by weakening Austria; Prussia
should form an alliance with France to drive out Austria and
make herself supreme in Germany. After their realization
by Bismarck these ideas have become sufficiently commonplace;
but they were nowise obvious when thus published by Lassalle.
In 1861 he published a great work in two volumes, <i>System der
erworbenen Rechte</i> (<i>System of Acquired Rights</i>).</p>

<p>Now began the short-lived activity which was to give him
an historical significance. It was early in 1862, when the
struggle of Bismarck with the Prussian liberals was already
begun. Lassalle, a democrat of the most advanced type, saw
that an opportunity had come for asserting a third great cause&mdash;that
of the working men&mdash;which would outflank the liberalism
of the middle classes, and might even command the sympathy
of the government. His political programme was, however,
entirely subordinate to the social, that of bettering the condition
of the working classes, for which he believed the schemes
of Schulze-Delitzsch were utterly inadequate. Lassalle flung
himself into the career of agitator with his accustomed vigour.
His worst difficulties were with the working men themselves,
among whom he met the most discouraging apathy. His
mission as organizer and emancipator of the working class lasted
only two years and a half. In that period he issued about twenty
separate publications, most of them speeches and pamphlets,
but one of them, that against Schulze-Delitzsch, a considerable
treatise, and all full of keen and vigorous thought. He founded
the &ldquo;Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein,&rdquo; was its president
and almost single-handed champion, conducted its affairs,
and carried on a vast correspondence, not to mention about
a dozen state prosecutions in which he was during that period
involved. Berlin, Leipzig, Frankfort and the industrial centres
on the Rhine were the chief scenes of his activity. His greatest
success was on the Rhine, where in the summers of 1863 and
1864 his travels as missionary of the new gospel resembled
a triumphal procession. The agitation was growing rapidly,
but he had achieved little substantial success when a most
unworthy death closed his career.</p>

<p>While posing as the messiah of the poor, Lassalle was a man
of decidedly fashionable and luxurious habits. His suppers
were well known as among the most exquisite in Berlin. It
was the most piquant feature of his life that he, one of the gilded
youth, a connoisseur in wines, and a learned man to boot, had
become agitator and the champion of the working man. In
one of the literary and fashionable circles of Berlin he had
met a Fräulein von Dönniges, for whom he at once felt a passion,
which was ardently reciprocated. In the summer of 1864
he met her again on the Rigi, when they resolved to marry.
She was a young lady of twenty, decidedly unconventional
and original in character, but the daughter of a Bavarian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>236</span>
diplomatist then resident at Geneva, who would have nothing to
do with Lassalle. The lady was imprisoned in her own room,
and soon, apparently under the influence of very questionable
pressure, renounced Lassalle in favour of another admirer, a
Wallachian, Count von Racowitza. Lassalle sent a challenge
both to the lady&rsquo;s father and her betrothed, which was accepted
by the latter. At the Carouge, a suburb of Geneva, the meeting
took place on the morning of August 28, 1864, when Lassalle
was mortally wounded, and he died on the 31st of August.
In spite of such a foolish ending, his funeral was that of a martyr,
and by many of his adherents he has been regarded since with
feelings almost of religious devotion.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Lassalle did not lay claim to any special originality as a socialistic
thinker, nor did he publish any systematic statement of his views.
Yet his leading ideas are sufficiently clear and simple. Like a true
Hegelian he saw three stages in the development of labour: the
ancient and feudal period, which, through the subjection of the
labourer, sought solidarity without freedom; the reign of capital and
the middle classes, established in 1789, which sought freedom by
destroying solidarity; and the new era, beginning in 1848, which
would reconcile solidarity with freedom by introducing the principle
of association. It was the basis and starting-point of his opinions
that, under the empire of capital and so long as the working man
was merely a receiver of wages, no improvement in his condition
could be expected. This position he founded on the law of wages
formulated by Ricardo, and accepted by all the leading economists,
that wages are controlled by the ordinary relations of supply and
demand, that a rise in wages leads to an increase in the labouring
population, which, by increasing the supply of labour, is followed by a
corresponding fall of wages. Thus population increases or decreases
in fixed relation to the rise or fall of wages. The condition of the
working man will never permanently rise above the mere standard of
living required for his subsistence, and the continued supply of his
kind. Lassalle held that the co-operative schemes of Schulze-Delitzsch
on the principle of &ldquo;self-help&rdquo; were utterly inadequate,
for the obvious reason that the working classes were destitute of
capital. The struggle of the working man helping himself with his
empty pockets against the capitalists he compared to a battle with
teeth and nails against modern artillery. In short, Lassalle accepted
the orthodox political economy to show that the inevitable
operation of its laws left no hope for the working classes, and that no
remedy could be found but by abolishing the conditions in which
these laws had their validity&mdash;in other words, by abolishing the
present relations of labour and capital altogether. And this could
only be done by the productive association of the working men with
money provided by the state. And he held that such association
should be the voluntary act of the working men, the government
merely reserving the right to examine the books of the various
societies. All the arrangements should be carried out according to
the rules of business usually followed in such transactions. But how
move the government to grant such a loan? Simply by introducing
(direct) universal suffrage. The working men were an overwhelming
majority; they were the state, and should control the government.
The aim of Lassalle, then, was to organize the working classes into
a great political power, which in the way thus indicated, by peaceful
resolute agitation, without violence or insurrection, might attain the
goal of productive association. In this way the fourth estate would
be emancipated from the despotism of the capitalist, and a great step
taken in the solution of the great &ldquo;social question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It will be seen that the net result of Lassalle&rsquo;s life was to produce
a European scandal, and to originate a socialistic movement in
Germany, which, at the election of 1903, returned to the Reichstag
eighty-one members and polled 3,010,771 votes, and at the election
of 1907 returned forty-three members and polled 3,258,968 votes.
(The diminution in the number of members returned in 1907 was due
mostly to combination among the different political groups.) This
result, great as it was, would hardly have been commensurate with
his ambition, which was boundless. In the heyday of his passion for
Fräulein von Dönniges, his dream was to be enthroned as the
president of the German republic with her seated at his side. With
his energy, ability and gift of dominating and organizing, he might
indeed have done a great deal. Bismarck coquetted with him as the
representative of a force that might help him to combat the Prussian
liberals; in 1878, in a speech before the Reichstag, he spoke of him
with deep respect, as a man of the greatest amiability and ability
from whom much could be learned. Even Bishop Ketteler of Mainz
had declared his sympathy for the cause he advocated.</p>

<p>Lassalle&rsquo;s <i>Die Philosophie Herakleitos des Dunklen von Ephesos</i>
(Berlin, 1858), and the <i>System der erworbenen Rechte</i> (Leipzig, 1861)
are both marked by great learning and intellectual power. But of
far more historical interest are the speeches and pamphlets connected
with his socialistic agitation, of which the most important
are&mdash;<i>Ueber Verfassungswesen</i>; <i>Arbeiterprogramm</i>; <i>Offenes Antwortschreiben</i>;
<i>Zur Arbeiterfrage</i>; <i>Arbeiterlesebuch</i>; <i>Herr Bastiat-Schulze
von Delitzsch, oder Kapital und Arbeit</i>. His drama, <i>Franz
von Sickingen</i>, published in 1859, is a work of no poetic value. His
<i>Collected Works</i> were issued at Leipzig in 1899-1901.</p>

<p>The best biography of Lassalle is H. Oncken&rsquo;s <i>Lassalle</i> (Stuttgart,
1904); another excellent work on his life and writings is George
Brandes&rsquo;s Danish work, <i>Ferdinand Lassalle</i> (German translation,
4th ed., Leipzig, 1900). See also A. Aaberg, <i>Ferdinand Lassalle</i>

Bernstein, <i>Ferd. Lassalle und seine Bedeutung für die Arbeiterklasse</i>
(Berlin, 1904). There is a considerable literature on his love affair
and death; the most notable books are: <i>Meine Beziehungen zu
F. Lassalle</i>, by Helene von Racowitza, a very strange book; <i>Enthüllungen
über das tragische Lebensende F. Lassalle&rsquo;s</i> by B. Becker;
<i>Im Anschluss an die Memoiren der H. von Racowitza</i>, by A. Kutschbach,
and George Meredith&rsquo;s <i>Tragic Comedians</i> (1880).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LASSEN, CHRISTIAN<a name="ar216" id="ar216"></a></span> (1800-1876), German orientalist, was
born on the 22nd of October 1800, at Bergen in Norway. Having
received his earliest university education at Christiania, he went
to Germany, and continued his studies at Heidelberg and Bonn.
In the latter university Lassen acquired a sound knowledge of
Sanskrit. He next spent three years in Paris and London,
engaged in copying and collating MSS., and collecting materials
for future research, especially in reference to the Hindu drama
and philosophy. During this period he published, jointly with
E. Burnouf, his first work, <i>Essai sur le Pâli</i> (Paris, 1826). On his
return to Bonn he studied Arabic, and took the degree of Ph.D.,
his dissertation discussing the Arabic notices of the geography
of the Punjab (<i>Commentatio geographica atque historica de
Pentapotamia Indica</i>, Bonn, 1827). Soon after he was admitted
<i>Privatdozent</i>, and in 1830 was appointed extraordinary and in
1840 ordinary professor of Old Indian language and literature.
In spite of a tempting offer from Copenhagen, in 1841, Lassen
remained faithful to the university of his adoption to the end of
his life. He died at Bonn on the 8th of May 1876, having been
affected with almost total blindness for many years. As early
as 1864 he was relieved of the duty of lecturing.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In 1829-1831 he brought out, in conjunction with August W. von
Schlegel, a critical annotated edition of the <i>Hitopade&#347;a</i>. The appearance
of this edition marks the starting-point of the critical study
of Sanskrit literature. At the same time Lassen assisted von
Schlegel in editing and translating the first two cantos of the epic
<i>R&#257;m&#257;yana</i> (1829-1838). In 1832 he brought out the text of the first
act of Bhavabh&#363;ti&rsquo;s drama, <i>M&#257;lat&#299;m&#257;dhava</i>, and a complete edition,
with a Latin translation, of the <i>S&#257;nkhya-k&#257;rik&#257;</i>. In 1837 followed
his edition and translation of Jayadeva&rsquo;s charming lyrical drama,
<i>G&#299;tagovinda</i> and his <i>Institutiones linguae Pracriticae</i>. His <i>Anthologia
Sanscritica</i>, which came out the following year (new ed. by Johann
Gildemeister, 1868), contained several hitherto unpublished texts,
and did much to stimulate the study of Sanskrit in German universities.
In 1846 Lassen brought out an improved edition of
Schlegel&rsquo;s text and translation of the &ldquo;Bhagavadg&#299;t&#257;.&rdquo; He did not
confine himself to the study of Indian languages, but acted likewise
as a scientific pioneer in other fields of philological inquiry. In his
<i>Beiträge zur Deutung der Eugubinischen Tafeln</i> (1833) he prepared
the way for the correct interpretation of the Umbrian inscriptions;
and the <i>Zeitschrift für die Kunde des Morgenlandes</i> (7 vols., 1837-1850),
started and largely conducted by him, contains, among other
valuable papers from his pen, grammatical sketches of the Beluchi
and Brahui languages, and an essay on the Lycian inscriptions.</p>

<p>Soon after the appearance of Burnouf&rsquo;s <i>Commentaire sur le Yaçna</i>
(1833), Lassen also directed his attention to the Zend, and to Iranian
studies generally; and in <i>Die altpersischen Keilinschriften von
Persepolis</i> (1836) he first made known the true character of the Old
Persian cuneiform inscriptions, thereby anticipating, by one month,
Burnouf&rsquo;s <i>Mémoire</i> on the same subject, while Sir Henry Rawlinson&rsquo;s
famous memoir on the Behistun inscription, though drawn up in
Persia, independently of contemporaneous European research, at
about the same time, did not reach the Royal Asiatic Society until
three years later. Subsequently Lassen published, in the sixth
volume of his journal (1845), a collection of all the Old Persian cuneiform
inscriptions known up to that date. He also was the first
scholar in Europe who took up, with signal success, the decipherment
of the newly-discovered Bactrian coins, which furnished him the
materials for <i>Zur Geschichte der griechischen und indo-skythischen
Könige in Bakterien, Kabul, und Indien</i> (1838). He contemplated
bringing out a critical edition of the <i>Vendidad</i>; but, after publishing
the first five fargards (1852), he felt that his whole energies were required
for the successful accomplishment of the great undertaking of
his life&mdash;his <i>Indische Altertumskunde</i>. In this work&mdash;completed in
four volumes, published respectively in 1847 (2nd ed., 1867), 1849
(2nd ed., 1874), 1858 and 1861&mdash;which forms one of the greatest
monuments of untiring industry and critical scholarship, everything
that could be gathered from native and foreign sources, relative to
the political, social and intellectual development of India, from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>237</span>
earliest times down to the Mahommedan invasion, was worked up

was born in Copenhagen, but was taken as a child to Brussels
and educated at the Brussels Conservatoire. He won the <i>prix
de Rome</i> in 1851, and went for a long tour in Germany and Italy.
He settled at Weimar, where in 1861 he succeeded Liszt as
conductor of the opera, and he died there on the 15th of
January 1904. Besides many well-known songs, he wrote
operas&mdash;<i>Landgraf Ludwig&rsquo;s Brautfahrt</i> (1857), <i>Frauenlob</i> (1861),
<i>Le Captif</i> (1868)&mdash;instrumental music to dramas, notably to
Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Faust</i> (1876), two symphonies and various choral works.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LASSO<a name="ar218" id="ar218"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Lassus</span>), <span class="bold">ORLANDO</span> (<i>c.</i> 1530-1594), Belgian musical
composer, whose real name was probably Roland Delattre, was
born at Mons, in Hainault, probably not much earlier than 1532,
the date given by the epitaph printed at the end of the volumes of
the <i>Magnum opus musicum</i>; though already in the 16th century
the opinions of his biographers were divided between the years
1520 and 1530. Much is reported, but very little known, of
his connexions and his early career. The discrepancy as to the
date of his birth appears also in connexion with his appointment
at the church of St John Lateran in Rome. If he was born in
1530 or 1532 he could not have obtained that appointment
in 1541. What is certain is that his first book of madrigals was
published in Venice in 1555, and that in the same year he speaks
of himself in the preface of Italian and French songs and Latin
motets as if he had recently come from Rome. He seems to have
visited England in 1554 and to have been introduced to Cardinal
Pole, to whom an adulatory motet appears in 1556. (This is
not, as might hastily be supposed, a confusion resulting from
the fact that the ambassador from Ferdinand, king of the Romans,
Don Pedro de Lasso, attended the marriage of Philip and Mary
in England in the same year.) His first book of motets appeared
at Antwerp in 1556, containing the motet in honour of Cardinal
Pole. The style of Orlando had already begun to purify itself
from the speculative and chaotic elements that led Burney, who
seems to have known only his earlier works, to call him &ldquo;a dwarf
on stilts&rdquo; as compared with Palestrina. But where he is
orthodox he is as yet stiff, and his secular compositions are, so
far, better than his more serious efforts.</p>

<p>In 1557, if not before, he was invited by Albrecht IV., duke
of Bavaria, to go to Munich. The duke was a most intelligent
patron of all the fine arts, a notable athlete, and a man of strict
principles. Munich from henceforth never ceased to be Orlando&rsquo;s
home; though he sometimes paid long visits to Italy and France,
whether in response to royal invitations or with projects of his
own. In 1558 he made a very happy marriage by which he had
four sons and two daughters. The four sons all became good
musicians, and we owe an inestimable debt to the pious industry
of the two eldest sons, who (under the patronage of Duke Maximilian
I., the second successor of Orlando&rsquo;s master) published the
enormous collection of Orlando&rsquo;s Latin motets known as the
<i>Magnum opus musicum</i>.</p>

<p>Probably no composer has ever had more ideal circumstances
for artistic inspiration and expression than had Orlando. His
duty was to make music all day and every day, and to make it
according to his own taste. Nothing was too good, too severe
or too new for the duke. Church music was not more in demand
than secular. Instrumental music, which in the 16th century
had hardly any independent existence, accompanied the meals
of the court; and Orlando would rise from dessert to sing trios
and quartets with picked voices. The daily prayers included
a full mass with polyphonic music. This amazing state of things
becomes more intelligible and less alarming when we consider
that 16th-century music was no sooner written than it could
be performed. With such material as Orlando had at his disposal,
musical performance was as unattended by expense and
tedious preliminaries as a game of billiards in a good billiard
room. Not even Haydn&rsquo;s position at Esterhaz can have enabled
him, as has been said, to &ldquo;ring the bell&rdquo; for musicians to come
and try a new orchestral effect with such ease as that with
which Orlando could produce his work at Munich. His fame soon
became world-wide, and every contemporary authority is full
of the acclamation with which Orlando was greeted wherever
his travels took him.</p>

<p>Very soon, with this rapid means of acquiring experience,
Orlando&rsquo;s style became as pure as Palestrina&rsquo;s; while he always
retained his originality and versatility. His relations to the
literary culture of the time are intimate and fascinating; and
during his stay at the court of France in 1571 he became a
friend of the poet Ronsard. In 1579 Duke Albrecht died.
Orlando&rsquo;s salary had already been guaranteed to him for life,
so that his outward circumstances did not change, and the new
duke was very kind to him. But the loss of his master was a
great grief and seems to have checked his activity for some time.
In 1589, after the publication of six Masses, ending with a
beautiful <i>Missa pro defunctis</i>, his strength began to fail; and
a sudden serious illness left him alarmingly depressed and
inactive until his death on the 14th of June 1594.</p>

<p>If Palestrina represents the supreme height attained by 16th-century
music, Orlando represents the whole century. It is
impossible to exaggerate the range and variety of his style,
so long as we recognise the limits of 16th-century musical
language. Even critics to whom this language is unfamiliar
cannot fail to notice the glaring differences between Orlando&rsquo;s
numerous types of art, though such critics may believe all those
types to be equally crude and archaic. The swiftness of Orlando&rsquo;s
intellectual and artistic development is astonishing. His first
four volumes of madrigals show a very intermittent sense of
beauty. Many a number in them is one compact mass of the
fashionable harsh play upon the &ldquo;false relation&rdquo; between twin
major and minor chords, which is usually believed to be the
unenviable distinction of the English madrigal style from that
of the Italians. It must be confessed that in the Italian madrigal
(as distinguished from the <i>villanella</i> and other light forms),
Orlando never attained complete certainty of touch, though
some of his later madrigals are indeed glorious. But in his
French chansons, many of which are settings of the poems of
his friend Ronsard, his wit and lightness of touch are unfailing.
In setting other French poems he is sometimes unfortunately
most witty where the words are most gross, for he is as free
from modern scruples as any of his Elizabethan contemporaries.
In 1562, when the Council of Trent was censuring the abuses of
Flemish church music, Orlando had already purified his ecclesiastical
style; though he did not go so far as to Italianize it in
order to oblige those modern critics who are unwilling to believe
that anything appreciably unlike Palestrina can be legitimate.
At the same time Orlando&rsquo;s Masses are not among his greatest
works. This is possibly partly due to the fact that the proportions
of a musical Mass are at the mercy of the local practice of the
liturgy; and that perhaps the uses of the court at Munich were
not quite so favourable to broadly designed proportion (not
length) as the uses of Rome. Differences which might cramp
the 16th-century composer need not amount to anything that
would draw down the censure of ecclesiastical authorities. Be
this as it may, Orlando&rsquo;s other church music is always markedly
different from Palestrina&rsquo;s, and often fully as sublime. It is
also in many ways far more modern in resource. We frequently
come upon things like the <i>Justorum animae</i> [Magnum Opus,
No. 260 (301)] which in their way are as overpoweringly touching
as, for example, the Benedictus of Beethoven&rsquo;s <i>Mass in D</i> or
the soprano solo in Brahms&rsquo;s <i>Deutsches Requiem</i>.</p>

<p>No one has approached Orlando in the ingenuity, quaintness
and humour of his tone-painting. He sometimes descends to
extremely elaborate musical puns, carrying farther than any
other composer since the dark ages the absurd device of setting
syllables that happened to coincide with the <i>sol-fa</i> system to
the corresponding <i>sol-fa</i> notes. But in the most absurd of such
cases he evidently enjoys twisting these notes into a theme of
pregnant musical meaning. The quaintest instance is the
motet <i>Quid estis pusillanimes</i> [Magnum Opus, No. 92 (69)]
where extra <i>sol-fa</i> syllables are introduced into the text to make
a good theme in combination with the syllables already there
by accident! (<i>An nescitis Justitiae Ut Sol</i> [<i>Fa Mi</i>] <i>Re Laxatas</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>238</span>
<i>habenas possit denuo cohibere?</i>). The significance of these
euphuistic jokes is that they always make good music in Orlando&rsquo;s
hands. There is musical fun even in his voluminous parody
of the stammering style of word-setting in the burlesque motet
<i>S.U.Su. PER. per. super F.L.U.</i>, which gets through one verse
of a psalm in fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>When it was a question of purely musical high spirits Orlando
was unrivalled; and his setting of Walter de Mape&rsquo;s <i>Fertur
in conviviis</i> (given in the <i>Magnum opus</i> with a stupid moral
derangement of the text), and most of his French chansons,
are among the most deeply humorous music in the world.</p>

<p>But it is in the tests of the sublime that Orlando shows himself
one of the greatest minds that ever found expression in art.
Nothing sublime was too unfamiliar to frighten him into repressing
his quaint fancy, though he early repressed all that thwarted
his musical nature. His <i>Penitential Psalms</i> stand with Josquin&rsquo;s
<i>Miserere</i> and Palestrina&rsquo;s first book of <i>Lamentations</i> as artistic
monuments of 16th-century penitential religion, just as Bach&rsquo;s
<i>Matthew Passion</i> stands alone among such monuments in later
art. Yet the passage (quoted by Sir Hubert Parry in vol. 3
of the <i>Oxford History of Music</i>) &ldquo;Nolite fieri sicut mulus&rdquo; is
one among many traits which are ingeniously and grotesquely
descriptive without losing harmony with the austere profundity
of the huge works in which they occur. It is impossible to read
any large quantity of Orlando&rsquo;s mature music without feeling
that a mind like his would in modern times have covered a
wider field of mature art than any one classical or modern
composer known to us. Yet we cannot say that anything has
been lost by his belonging to the 16th century. His music, if
only from its peculiar technique of crossing parts and unexpected
intervals, is exceptionally difficult to read; and hence intelligent
conducting and performance of it is rare. But its impressiveness
is beyond dispute; and there are many things which, like the
<i>Justorum animae</i> cannot even be read, much less heard, without
emotion.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Orlando&rsquo;s works as shown by the plan of Messrs Breitkopf &amp;
Härtel&rsquo;s complete critical edition (begun in 1894) comprise: (1) the
<i>Magnum opus musicum</i>, a posthumous collection containing Latin
pieces for from two to twelve voices, 516 in number (or, counting by
single movements, over 700). Not all of these are to the original
texts. The <i>Magnum opus</i> fills eleven volumes. (2) Five volumes of
madrigals, containing six books, and a large number of single
madrigals, and about half a volume of lighter Italian songs (villanellas,
&amp;c.). (3) Three volumes (not four as in the prospectus) of
French <i>chansons</i>. (4) Two volumes of German four-part and five-part
<i>Lieder</i>. (5) Serial church music: three volumes, containing
<i>Lessons from the Book of Job</i> (two settings). <i>Passion according to St
Matthew</i> (<i>i.e.</i> like the Passions of Victoria and Soriano, a setting of
the words of the crowds and of the disciples); <i>Lamentations</i> of
Jeremiah; <i>Morning Lessons</i>; the <i>Officia</i> printed in the third volume
of the <i>Patroncinium</i> (a publication suggested and supported by
Orlando&rsquo;s patrons and containing eight entire volumes of his works);
the Seven Penitential Psalms; German Psalms and <i>Prophetiae
Sibyllarum</i>, (6) one hundred <i>Magnificats</i> (<i>Jubilus B. M. Virginis</i>)
3 vols., (7) eight volumes of Masses, (8) two volumes of Latin songs

<p><span class="bold">LASSO<a name="ar219" id="ar219"></a></span> (Span. <i>lazo</i>, snare, ultimately from Lat. <i>laqueus</i>, cf.
&ldquo;lace&rdquo;), a rope 60 to 100 ft. in length with a slip-noose at one
end, used in the Spanish and Portuguese parts of America and
in the western United States for catching wild horses and cattle.
It is now less employed in South America than in the vast
grazing country west of the Mississippi river, where the herders,
called locally cow-boys or cow-punchers, are provided with it.
When not in use, the lasso, called <i>rope</i> in the West, is coiled at
the right of the saddle in front of the rider. When an animal
is to be caught the herder, galloping after it, swings the coiled
lasso round his head and casts it straight forward in such a
manner that the noose settles over the head or round the legs
of the quarry, when it is speedily brought into submission. A
shorter rope called <i>lariat</i> (Span. <i>la reata</i>) is used to picket horses.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAST.<a name="ar220" id="ar220"></a></span> 1. (A syncopated form of &ldquo;latest,&rdquo; the superlative
of O.E. <i>laét</i>, late), an adjective applied to the conclusion of
anything, all that remains after everything else has gone, or
that which has just occurred. In theology the &ldquo;four last
things&rdquo; denote the final scenes of Death, Judgment, Heaven
and Hell; the &ldquo;last day&rdquo; means the Day of Judgment (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Eschatology</a></span>).</p>

<p>2. (O.E. <i>lást</i>, footstep; the word appears in many Teutonic
languages, meaning foot, footstep, track, &amp;c.; it is usually
referred to a Teutonic root <i>lais</i>, cognate with Lat. <i>lira</i>, a furrow;
from this root, used figuratively, came &ldquo;learn&rdquo; and &ldquo;lore&rdquo;),
originally a footstep, trace or track, now only used of the model
of a foot in wood on which a shoemaker makes boots and shoes;
hence the proverb &ldquo;let the cobbler stick to his last,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>ne sutor

<p>3. (O.E. <i>hlaest</i>; the work is connected with the root seen in
&ldquo;lade,&rdquo; and is used in German and Dutch of a weight; it is also
seen in &ldquo;ballast&rdquo;), a commercial weight or measure of quantity,
varying according to the commodity and locality; originally
applied to the load of goods carried by the boat or wagon used in
carrying any particular commodity in any particular locality,
it is now chiefly used as a weight for fish, a &ldquo;last&rdquo; of herrings
being equal to from 10,000 to 12,000 fish. The German <i>Last</i> =
4000 &#8468;, and this is frequently taken as the nominal weight of an
English &ldquo;last.&rdquo; A &ldquo;last&rdquo; of wool = 12 sacks, and of beer = 12

<p><span class="bold">LASUS,<a name="ar221" id="ar221"></a></span> Greek lyric poet, of Hermione in Argolis, flourished
about 510 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> A member of the literary and artistic circle of
the Peisistratidae, he was the instructor of Pindar in music and
poetry and the rival of Simonides. The dithyramb (of which
he was sometimes considered the actual inventor) was developed
by him, by the aid of various changes in music and rhythm, into
an artistically constructed choral song, with an accompaniment
of several flutes. It became more artificial and mimetic in
character, and its range of subjects was no longer confined to the
adventures of Dionysus. Lasus further increased its popularity
by introducing prize contests for the best poem of the kind.
His over-refinement is shown by his avoidance of the letter
<i>sigma</i> (on account of its hissing sound) in several of his poems,
of one of which (a hymn to Demeter of Hermione) a few lines
have been preserved in Athenaeus (xiv. 624 E). Lasus was also
the author of the first theoretical treatise on music.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LAS VEGAS,<a name="ar222" id="ar222"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of San Miguel county,
New Mexico, U.S.A., in the north central part of New Mexico,
on the Gallinas river, and 83 m. by rail E. of Santa Fé. Though
usually designated as a single municipality, Las Vegas consists
of two distinct corporations, the old town on the W. bank of the
river and the city proper on the E. bank. Pop. of the city (1890)
2385; (1900) 3552 (340 being foreign-born and 116 negroes);
(1910) 3755. According to local estimates, the combined
population of the city and the old town in 1908 was 10,000. Las
Vegas is served by the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fé railway,
and is its division headquarters in New Mexico. The city lies
in a valley at the foot of the main range of the Rocky Mountains,
and is about 6400 ft. above the sea. There are high peaks to the
W. and within a short distance of the city much beautiful
mountain scenery, especially along the &ldquo;Scenic Route,&rdquo; a
highway from Las Vegas to Santa Fé, traversing the Las Vegas
canyon and the Pecos Valley forest reserve. The country E. of
the city consists of level plains. The small amount of rainfall, the
great elevation and the southern latitude give the region a dry
and rarified air, and Las Vegas is a noted health resort. Six miles
distant, and connected with the city by rail, are the Las Vegas
Hot Springs. The old town on the W. bank of the Gallinas
river retains many features of a Mexican village, with low adobe
houses facing narrow and crooked streets. Its inhabitants are
largely of Spanish-American descent. The part on the E. bank
or city proper is thoroughly modern, with well-graded streets,
many of them bordered with trees. The most important public
institutions are the New Mexico insane asylum, the New Mexico
normal university (chartered 1893, opened 1898), the county
court house (in the old town), the academy of the Immaculate
Conception, conducted by the Sisters of Loretto, Saint Anthony&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>239</span>
sanatorium, maintained by the Sisters of Charity, La Salle
institute, conducted by the Christian Brothers, a Presbyterian
mission school and a Methodist manual training and commercial
school. There are railway machine-shops, and various manufactories.
Las Vegas lies in the centre of an extensive grazing
region, has large stockyards and annually ships great quantities
of wool. Three of the local newspapers are published in Spanish.
Las Vegas was founded in 1835, under the government of the
Mexican Republic. On the 15th of August 1846, during the war
between Mexico and the United States, Gen. Stephen W. Kearny
entered the town, and its alcalde took the oath of allegiance to
the United States. There was but little progress or development
until the arrival of the railway in 1879. In 1888 the part east
of the river was incorporated as a town under the name of East
Las Vegas, and in 1896 it was chartered as the city of Las Vegas.
The old Las Vegas, west of the river, was incorporated as a town
in 1903.</p>

Lake, and the Mahratta troops of Sindia, consisting of the
remnant of Perron&rsquo;s battalions. Laswari is a village in the state
of Alwar some 80 m. S. of Delhi, and here Lake overtook the
enemy and attacked them with his cavalry before the infantry
arrived. The result was indecisive, but when the infantry came
up there ensued one of the most evenly contested battles ever
fought between the British and the natives of India, which ended
in a complete victory for the British.</p>

a plateau town of Ecuador, capital of the province of Léon,
46 m. S. of Quito, near the confluence of the Alagues and Cutuchi
to form the Patate, the headstream of the Pastaza. Pop. (1900,
estimate) 12,000, largely Indian. Latacunga stands on the old
road between Guayaquil and Quito and has a station on the
railway between those cities. It is 9141 ft. above sea-level;
and its climate is cold and unpleasant, owing to the winds from
the neighbouring snowclad heights, and the barren, pumice-covered
table-land on which it stands. Cotopaxi is only 25 m.
distant, and the town has suffered repeatedly from eruptions.
Founded in 1534, it was four times destroyed by earthquakes
between 1698 and 1798. The neighbouring ruins of an older
native town are said to date from the Incas.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA TAILLE, JEAN DE<a name="ar225" id="ar225"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1540-1608), French poet and
dramatist, was born at Bondaroy. He studied the humanities
in Paris under Muret, and law at Orleans under Anne de Bourg.
He began his career as a Huguenot, but afterwards adopted a
mild Catholicism. He was wounded at the battle of Arnay-le
Duc in 1570, and retired to his estate at Bondaroy, where he
wrote a political pamphlet entitled <i>Histoire abrégée des singeries
de la ligue</i>, often published with the <i>Satire Ménippée</i>. His
chief poem is a satire on the follies of court life, <i>Le Courtisan
retiré</i>; he also wrote a political poem, <i>Le Prince nécessaire</i>.
But his fame rests on his achievements in drama. In 1572
appeared the tragedy of <i>Saül le furieux</i>, with a preface on <i>L&rsquo; Art de
la tragédie</i>. Like Jodelle, Grévin, La Péruse and their followers,
he wrote, not for the general public to which the mysteries and
farces had addressed themselves, but for the limited audience
of a lettered aristocracy. He therefore depreciated the native
drama and insisted on the Senecan model. In his preface La
Taille enunciates the unities of place, time and action; he
maintains that each act should have a unity of its own and that
the scenes composing it should be continuous; he objects to
deaths on the stage on the ground that the representation is unconvincing,
and he requires as subject of the tragedy an incident
really terrible, developed, if possible, by elaborate intrigue.
He criticizes <i>e.g.</i> the subject of the sacrifice of Abraham, chosen by
Théodore de Bèze for his tragedy (1551), as unsuitable because
&ldquo;pity and terror&rdquo; are evoked from the spectators without real
cause. If in <i>Saül le furieux</i> he did not completely carry out his
own convictions he developed his principal character with great
ability. A second tragedy, <i>La Famine ou les Gabéonites</i> (1573),
is inferior in construction, but is redeemed by the character of
Rizpah. He was also the author of two comedies, <i>Le Négromant</i>
and <i>Les Corrivaux</i>, both written apparently by 1562 but not
published until 1573. <i>Les Corrivaux</i> is remarkable for its colloquial
prose dialogue, which foreshadows the excellence of later
French comedy.</p>

<p>His brother, <span class="sc">Jacques de la Taille</span> (1542-1562), composed a
number of tragedies, of which <i>La Mort de Daire</i> and <i>La Mort
d&rsquo;Alexandre</i> (both published in 1573) are the chief. He is best
known by his <i>Manière de faire des vers en français comme en grec
et en latin</i>, an attempt to regulate French verse by quantity.
He died of plague at the age of 20. His <i>Poésies diverses</i> were
published in 1572.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LATAKIA<a name="ar226" id="ar226"></a></span> (anc. <i>Laodicea</i>), the chief town of a sanjak in
the Beirut vilayet of Syria, situated on the coast, opposite
the island of Cyprus. The oldest name of the town, according
to Philo Herennius, was <span class="grk" title="Ramitha">&#929;&#940;&#956;&#953;&#952;&#945;</span> or <span class="grk" title="Leukè aktê">&#923;&#949;&#965;&#954;&#8052; &#7936;&#954;&#964;&#942;</span> it received
that of Laodicea (<i>ad mare</i>) from Seleucus Nicator, who refounded
it in honour of his mother as one of the four &ldquo;sister&rdquo;
cities of the Syrian Tetrapolis (Antioch, Seleucia, Apamea,
Laodicea). In the Roman period it was favoured by Caesar,
and took the name of Julia; and, though it suffered severely
when the fugitive Dolabella stood his last siege within its walls
(43 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Strabo describes it as a flourishing port, which supplied,
from the vineyards on the mountains, the greater part of the
wine imported to Alexandria. The town received the privileges
of an Italian colony from Severus, for taking his part against
Antioch in the struggle with Niger. Laodicea was the seat
of an ancient bishopric, and even had some claim to metropolitan
rights. At the time of the crusades, &ldquo;Liche,&rdquo; as Jacques
de Vitry says it was popularly called, was a wealthy city. It
fell to Tancred with Antioch in 1102, and was recovered by
Saladin in 1188. A Christian settlement was afterwards permitted
to establish itself in the town, and to protect itself by
fortifications; but it was expelled by Sultan Kala&rsquo;&#363;n and the
defences destroyed. By the 16th century Laodicea had sunk
very low; the revival in the beginning of the 17th was due
to the new trade in tobacco. The town has several times been
almost destroyed by earthquakes&mdash;in 1170, 1287 and 1822.</p>

<p>The people are chiefly employed in tobacco cultivation, silk
and oil culture, poultry rearing and the sponge fishery. There
is a large export of eggs to Alexandria; but the wealth of the
place depends most on the famous &ldquo;Latakia&rdquo; tobacco, grown
in the plain behind the town and on the Ansarieh hills. There
are three main varieties, of which the worst is dark in colour
and strong in flavour; the best, grown in the districts of Diryus
and Amamareh, is light and aromatic, and is exported mainly
to Alexandria; but much goes also to Constantinople, Cyprus
and direct to Europe. After the construction of a road through
Jebel Ansarieh to Hamah, Latakia drew a good deal of traffic
from upper Syria; but the Hamah-Homs railway has now
diverted much of this again. The products of the surrounding
district, however, cause the town to increase steadily, and it
is a regular port of call for the main Levantine lines of steamers.
The only notable object of antiquity is a triumphal arch, probably
of the early 3rd century, in the S.E. quarter of the modern
town. Latakia and its neighbourhood formerly produced a
very beautiful type of rug, examples of which are highly
prized.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LA TÈNE<a name="ar228" id="ar228"></a></span> (Lat. <i>tenuis</i>, shallow), the site of a lake-dwelling
at the north end of Lake Neuchâtel, between Marin and Préfargier.
According to some, it was originally a Helvetic <i>oppidum</i>;
according to others, a Gallic commercial settlement.
R. Forrer distinguishes an older semi-military, and a younger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>240</span>
civilian settlement, the former a Gallic customs station, the
latter, which may be compared to the <i>canabae</i> of the Roman
camps, containing the booths and taverns used by soldiers and
sailors. He also considers the older station to have been, not
as usually supposed, Helvetic, but pre- or proto-Helvetic, the
character of which changed with the advance of the Helvetii
into Switzerland (<i>c.</i> 110-100 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). La Tène has given its name
to a period of culture (<i>c.</i> 500 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>-<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 100), the phase of the
Iron age succeeding the Hallstatt phase, not as being its starting-point,
but because the finds are the best known of their kind.
The latter are divided into early (<i>c.</i> 500-250 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), middle (250-100
<span class="scs">B.C.</span>) and late (100 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>-<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 100), and chiefly belong to the
middle period. They are mostly of iron, and consist of swords,
spear-heads, axes, scythes and knives, which exhibit a remarkable
agreement with the description of the weapons of the
southern Celts given by Diodorus Siculus. There are also
brooches, bronze kettles, torques, small bronze ear-rings with
little glass pearls of various colours, belt-hooks and pins for
fastening articles of clothing. The La Tène culture made its
way through France across to England, where it has received
the name of &ldquo;late Celtic&rdquo;; a remarkable find has been made
at Aylesford in Kent.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LATERAN COUNCILS,<a name="ar229" id="ar229"></a></span> the ecclesiastical councils or synods
held at Rome in the Lateran basilica which was dedicated to
Christ under the title of Salvator, and further called the basilica
of Constantine or the church of John the Baptist. Ranking
as a papal cathedral, this became a much-favoured place of
assembly for ecclesiastical councils both in antiquity (313,
487) and more especially during the middle ages. Among
these numerous synods the most prominent are those which the
tradition of the Roman Catholic church has classed as ecumenical
councils.</p>

<p>1. The first Lateran council (the ninth ecumenical) was
opened by Pope Calixtus II. on the 18th of March 1123; its
primary object being to confirm the concordat of Worms, and
so close the conflict on the question of investiture (<i>q.v.</i>). In
addition to this, canons were enacted against simony and the
marriage of priests; while resolutions were passed in favour
of the crusaders, of pilgrims to Rome and in the interests of the
truce of God. More than three hundred bishops are reported
to have been present.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>For the resolutions see <i>Monumenta Germaniae</i>, Leges, iv., i. 574-576
(1893); Mansi, <i>Collectio Conciliorum</i>, xxi. p. 281 sq.; Hefele,
<i>Conciliengeschichte</i>, v. 378-384 (ed. 2, 1886).</p>
</div>

<p>2. The second Lateran, and tenth ecumenical, council was
held by Pope Innocent II. in April 1139, and was attended by
close on a thousand clerics. Its immediate task was to neutralize
the after-effects of the schism, which had only been terminated
in the previous year by the death of Anacletus II. (d. 25th
January 1138). All consecrations received at his hands were
declared invalid, his adherents were deposed, and King Roger
of Sicily was excommunicated. Arnold of Brescia, too, was
removed from office and banished from Italy.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Resolutions, ap. Mansi, op. cit. xxi., 525 sq.; Hefele, <i>Conciliengeschichte</i>,
v. 438-445 (ed. 2).</p>
</div>

<p>3. At the third Lateran council (eleventh ecumenical), which
met in March 1179 under Pope Alexander III., the clergy present
again numbered about one thousand. The council formed
a sequel to the peace of Venice (1177), which marked the close
of the struggle between the papacy and the emperor Frederick I.
Barbarossa; its main object being to repair the direct or indirect
injuries which the schism had inflicted on the life of the
church and to display to Christendom the power of the see of
Rome. Among the enactments of the council, the most important
concerned the appointment to the papal throne (Canon 1),
the electoral law of 1059 being supplemented by a further provision
declaring a two-thirds majority to be requisite for the
validity of the cardinals&rsquo; choice. Of the participation of the
Roman clergy and populace, or of the imperial ratification, there
was no longer any question. Another resolution, of importance
for the history of the treatment of heresy, was the canon which
decreed that armed force should be employed against the Cathari
in southern France, that their goods were liable to confiscation
and their persons to enslavement by the princes, and that all
who took up weapons against them should receive a two years&rsquo;
remission of their penance and be placed&mdash;like the crusaders&mdash;under
the direct protection of the church.</p>

<p>4. The fourth Lateran council (twelfth ecumenical), convened
by Pope Innocent III. in 1215, was the most brilliant and the
most numerously attended of all, and marks the culminating
point of a pontificate which itself represents the zenith attained
by the medieval papacy. Prelates assembled from every country
in Christendom, and with them the deputies of numerous
princes. The total included 412 bishops, with 800 priors and
abbots, besides the representatives of absent prelates and a
number of inferior clerics. The seventy decrees of the council
begin with a confession of faith directed against the Cathari and
Waldenses, which is significant if only for the mention of a
transubstantiation of the elements in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. A
series of resolutions provided in detail for the organized suppression
of heresy and for the institution of the episcopal inquisition
(Canon 3). On every Christian, of either sex, arrived
at years of discretion, the duty was imposed of confessing at
least once annually and of receiving the Eucharist at least at
Easter (Canon 21). Enactments were also passed touching
procedure in the ecclesiastical courts, the creation of new monastic
orders, appointments to offices in the church, marriage-law,
conventual discipline, the veneration of relics, pilgrimages and
intercourse with Jews and Saracens. Finally, a great crusade
was resolved upon, to defray the expenses of which it was
determined that the clergy should lay aside one-twentieth&mdash;the
pope and the cardinals one-tenth&mdash;of their revenues for the
next three years; while the crusaders were to be held free of
all burdens during the period of their absence.</p>

<p>5. The fifth Lateran council (eighteenth ecumenical) was
convened by Pope Julius II. and continued by Leo X. It met
from the 3rd of May 1512 to the 16th of March 1517, and was the
last great council anterior to the Reformation. The change in
the government of the church, the rival council of Pisa, the
ecclesiastical and political dissensions within and without the
council, and the lack of disinterestedness on the part of its
members, all combined to frustrate the hopes which its convocation
had awakened. Its resolutions comprised the rejection of
the pragmatic sanction, the proclamation of the pope&rsquo;s superiority
over the council, and the renewal of the bull <i>Unam sanctam</i>
of Boniface VIII. The theory that it is possible for a thing to be
theologically true and philosophically false, and the doctrine of
the mortality of the human soul, were both repudiated; while
a three years&rsquo; tithe on all church property was set apart to
provide funds for a war against the Turks.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LATERITE<a name="ar230" id="ar230"></a></span> (Lat. <i>later</i>, a brick), in petrology, a red or brown
superficial deposit of clay or earth which gathers on the surface
of rocks and has been produced by their decomposition; it is
very common in tropical regions. In consistency it is generally
soft and friable, but hard masses, nodules and bands often occur
in it. These are usually rich in iron. The superficial layers
of laterite deposits are often indurated and smooth black or dark-brown
crusts occur where the clays have long been exposed
to a dry atmosphere; in other cases the soft clays are full of hard
nodules, and in general the laterite is perforated by tubules,
sometimes with veins of different composition and appearance
from the main mass. The depth of the laterite beds varies up
to 30 or 40 ft., the deeper layers often being soft when the
surface is hard or stony; the transition to fresh, sound rock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>241</span>
below may be very sudden. That laterite is merely rotted
crystalline rock is proved by its often preserving the structures,
veins and even the outlines of the minerals of the parent mass
below; the felspars and other components of granite gneiss
having evidently been converted <i>in situ</i> into a soft argillaceous
material.</p>

<p>Laterite occurs in practically every tropical region of the earth,
and is very abundant in Ceylon, India, Burma, Central and
West Africa, Central America, &amp;c. It is especially well developed
where the underlying rock is crystalline and felspathic (as
granite gneiss, syenite and diorite), but occurs also on basalts
in the Deccan and in other places, and is found even on mica
schist, sandstone and quartzite, though in such cases it tends
to be more sandy than argillaceous. Many varieties have been
recognized. In India a calcareous laterite with large concretionary
blocks of carbonate of lime is called kankar (kunkar), and
has been much used in building bridges, &amp;c., because it serves as
a hydraulic cement. In some districts (<i>e.g.</i> W. Indies) similar
types of laterite have been called &ldquo;puzzuolana&rdquo; and are also
used as mortar and cement. Kankar is also known and worked
in British East Africa. The clay called cabook in Ceylon is
essentially a variety of laterite. Common laterite contains very
little lime, and it seems that in districts which have an excessive
rainfall that component may be dissolved out by percolating
water, while kankar, or calcareous laterite, is formed in districts
which have a smaller rainfall. In India also a distinction is
made between &ldquo;high-level&rdquo; and &ldquo;low-level&rdquo; laterites. The
former are found at all elevations up to 5000 ft. and more,
and are the products of the decomposition of rock <i>in situ</i>; they
are often fine-grained and sometimes have a very well-marked
concretionary structure. These laterites are subject to removal
by running water, and are thus carried to lower grounds forming
transported or &ldquo;low-level&rdquo; laterites. The finer particles tend
to be carried away into the rivers, while the sand is left behind
and with it much of the heavy iron oxides. In such situations
the laterites are sandy and ferruginous, with a smaller proportion
of clay, and are not intimately connected with the rocks on
which they lie. On steep slopes laterite also may creep or slip
when soaked with rain, and if exposed in sections on roadsides
or river banks has a bedded appearance, the stratification being
parallel to the surface of the ground.</p>

<p>Chemical and microscopical investigations show that laterite
is not a clay like those which are so familiar in temperate regions;
it does not consist of hydrous silicate of alumina, but is a
mechanical mixture of fine grains of quartz with minute scales
of hydrates of alumina. The latter are easily soluble in acid
while clay is not, and after treating laterite with acids the alumina
and iron leave the silica as a residue in the form of quartz.
The alumina seems to be combined with variable proportions of
water, probably as the minerals hydrargillite, diaspore and
gibbsite, while the iron occurs as goethite, turgite, limonite,
haematite. As already remarked, there is a tendency for the
superficial layers to become hard, probably by a loss of the
water contained in these aluminous minerals. These chemical
changes may be the cause of the frequent concretionary structure
and veining in the laterite. The great abundance of alumina
in some varieties of laterite is a consequence of the removal
of the fine particles of gibbsite, &amp;c., from the quartz by the
action of gentle currents of water. We may also point out the
essential chemical similarity between laterite and the seams of
bauxite which occur, for example, in the north of Ireland as
reddish clays between flows of Tertiary basalt. The bauxite is
rich in alumina combined with water, and is used as an ore of
aluminium. It is often very ferruginous. Similar deposits
occur at Vogelsberg in Germany, and we may infer that the
bauxite beds are layers of laterite produced by sub-aerial decomposition
in the same manner as the thick laterite deposits
which are now in course of formation in the plateau basalts of
the Deccan in India.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The conditions under which laterite are formed include, first, a
high seasonal temperature, for it occurs only in tropical districts and
in plains or mountains up to about 5000 ft. in height; secondly, a
heavy rainfall, with well-marked alternation of wet and dry seasons
(in arid countries laterite is seldom seen, and where the rainfall is
moderate the laterite is often calcareous); third, the presence of
rocks containing aluminous minerals such as felspar, augite, hornblende
and mica. On pure limestones such as coral rocks and on
quartzites laterite deposits do not originate except where the material
has been transported.</p>

<p>Many hypotheses have been advanced to account for the essential
difference between lateritization and the weathering processes
exhibited by rocks in temperate and arctic climates. In the tropics
the rank growth of vegetation produces large amounts of humus and
carbonic acid which greatly promote rock decomposition; igneous
and crystalline rocks of all kinds are deeply covered under rich dark
soils, so that in tropical forests the underlying rocks are rarely to be
seen. In the warm soil nitrification proceeds rapidly and bacteria
of many kinds flourish. It has also been argued that the frequent
thunderstorms produce much nitric acid in the atmosphere and that
this may be a cause of lateritization, but it is certainly not a necessary
factor, as beds of laterite occur in oceanic islands lying in regions of
the ocean where lightning is rarely seen. Sir Thomas Holland has
brought forward the suggestion that the development of laterite
may depend on the presence in the soil of bacteria which are able to
decompose silicate of alumina into quartz and hydrates of alumina.
The restricted distribution of laterite deposits might then be due to
the inhibiting effect of low temperatures on the reproduction of these
organisms. This very ingenious hypothesis has not yet received the
experimental confirmation which seems necessary before it can be
regarded as established. Malcolm Maclaren, rejecting the bacterial
theory, directs special attention to the alternate saturation of the soil
with rain water in the wet season and desiccation in the subsequent
drought. The laterite beds are porous, in fact they are traversed by
innumerable tubules which are often lined with deposits of iron oxide
and aluminous minerals. We may be certain that, as in all soils
during dry weather, there is an ascent of water by capillary action
towards the surface, where it is gradually dissipated by evaporation.
The soil water brings with it mineral matter in solution, which is
deposited in the upper part of the beds. If the alumina be at one
time in a soluble condition it will be drawn upwards and concentrated
near the surface. This process explains many peculiarities of
laterites, such as their porous and slaggy structure, which is often so
marked that they have been mistaken for slaggy volcanic rocks.
The concretionary structure is undoubtedly due to chemical rearrangements,
among which the escape of water is probably one of
the most important; and many writers have recognized that the
hard ferruginous crust, like the induration which many soft laterites
undergo when dug up and exposed to the air, is the result of desiccation
and exposure to the hot sun of tropical countries. The brecciated
structure which many laterites show may be produced by great
expansion of the mass consequent on absorption of water after heavy
rains, followed by contraction during the subsequent dry season.</p>

<p>Laterites are not of much economic use. They usually form a
poor soil, full of hard concretionary lumps and very unfertile because
the potash and phosphates have been removed in solution, while only
alumina, iron and silica are left behind. They are used as clays for
puddling, for making tiles, and as a mortar in rough work. Kankar
has filled an important part as a cement in many large engineering
works in India. Where the iron concretions have been washed out
by rains or by artificial treatment (often in the form of small shot-like
pellets) they serve as an iron ore in parts of India and Africa.
Attempts are being made to utilize laterite as an ore of aluminium,
a purpose for which some varieties seem well adapted. There are
also deposits of manganese associated with some laterites in India
which may ultimately be valuable as mineral ores.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LATH<a name="ar231" id="ar231"></a></span> (O. Eng. <i>laett</i>, Mid. Eng. <i>lappe</i>, a form possibly due to
the Welsh <i>llath</i>; the word appears in many Teutonic languages,
cf. Dutch <i>lat</i>, Ger. <i>Latte</i>, and has passed into Romanic, cf. Ital.
<i>latta</i>, Fr. <i>latte</i>), a thin flat strip of wood or other material used in
building to form a base or groundwork for plaster, or for tiles,
slates or other covering for roofs. Such strips of wood are
employed to form lattice-work, or for the bars of venetian
blinds or shutters. A &ldquo;lattice&rdquo; (O. Fr. <i>lattis</i>) is an interlaced
structure of laths fastened together so as to form a screen with
diamond-shaped or square interstices. Such a screen was used,
as it still is in the East, as a shutter for a window admitting air
rather than light; it was hence used of the window closed by
such a screen. In modern usage the term is applied to a window
with diamond-shaped panes set in lead-work. A window with
a lattice painted red was formerly a common inn-sign (cf.
Shakespeare, <i>2 Hen. IV.</i> ii. 2. 86); frequently the window was
dispensed with, and the sign remained painted on a board.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LATHE.<a name="ar232" id="ar232"></a></span> (1) A mechanical appliance in which material is
held and rotated against a tool for cutting, scraping, polishing
or other purpose (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tools</a></span>). This word is of obscure origin.
It may be a modified form of &ldquo;lath,&rdquo; for in an early form of
lathe the rotation is given by a treadle or spring lath attached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>242</span>
to the ceiling. The <i>New English Dictionary</i> points out a possible
source of the word in Dan. <i>lad</i>, meaning apparently a supporting
framework, found in the name of the turning-lathe, <i>drejelad</i>, and
also in <i>savelad</i>, saw-bench, <i>vaeverlad</i>, loom, &amp;c. (2) One of five,
formerly six, districts containing three or more hundreds, into
which the county of Kent was divided. Though the division
survives, it no longer serves any administrative purpose. It
was formerly a judicial division, the court of the lathe being
superior to that of the hundred. In this it differs from the
rape (<i>q.v.</i>) of Sussex, which was a geographical rather than an
administrative division. In O. Eng. the word was <i>laéð</i>, the
origin of which is doubtful. The <i>New English Dictionary</i>
considers it almost certainly identical with O. Norse <i>lad</i>, landed
possessions, territory, with a possible association in meaning
with such words as <i>leið</i>, court, <i>mótlaeaða</i>, attendance at a meeting
or moot, or with Mod. Dan. <i>laegd</i>, a division of the country for
military purposes.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LATHROP, FRANCIS<a name="ar233" id="ar233"></a></span> (1849-1909), American artist, was born
at sea, near the Hawaiian Islands, on the 22nd of June 1849,
being the great-grandson of Samuel Holden Parsons, and the
son of George Alfred Lathrop (1819-1877), who for some time
was United States consul at Honolulu. He was a pupil of T. C.
Farrar (1838-1891) in New York, and studied at the Royal
academy of Dresden. In 1870-1873 he was in England, studying
under Ford Madox Brown and Burne-Jones, and working in the
school of William Morris, where he devoted particular attention
to stained glass. Returning to America in 1873, he became
known as an illustrator, painted portraits, designed stained
glass, and subsequently confined himself to decorative work.
He designed the chancel of Trinity church, Boston, and decorated
the interior of Bowdoin college chapel, at Brunswick, Maine,
and several churches in New York. The Marquand memorial
window, Princeton chapel, is an example of his work in stained
glass. His latest work was a series of medallions for the building
of the Hispanic-American society in New York. He was one of
the charter members of the Society of American Artists, and
became an associate of the National Academy of Design, New
York, of which also William L. Lathrop (b. 1859) an artist
who is to be distinguished from him, became a member in
1907. He died at Woodcliff, New Jersey, on the 18th of
October 1909.</p>

<p>His younger brother, <span class="sc">George Parsona Lathrop</span> (1851-1898),
born near Honolulu on the 25th of August 1851, took up literature
as a profession. He was an assistant editor of the <i>Atlantic
Monthly</i> in 1875-1877, and editor of the Boston <i>Courier</i> in 1877-1879.
He was one of the founders (1883) of the American
copyright league, was prominent in the movement for Roman
Catholic summer schools, and wrote several novels, some
verse and critical essays. He was the author of <i>A Study of
Nathaniel Hawthorne</i> (1876), and edited the standard edition
(Boston, 1883) of Hawthorne&rsquo;s works. In 1871 he married
in London the second daughter of Nathaniel Hawthorne&mdash;Rose
Hawthorne Lathrop (b. 1851). After his death Mrs
Lathrop devoted herself entirely to charity. She was instrumental
in establishing (1896) and subsequently conducted St
Rose&rsquo;s free home for cancer in New York City. In 1900 she
joined the Dominican order, taking the name of Mother Mary
Alphonsa and becoming superioress of the Dominican community
of the third order; and she established in 1901 and subsequently
conducted this order&rsquo;s Rosary Hill home (for cancerous patients)
at Hawthorne, N.Y. She published a volume of poems (1888);
<i>Memories of Hawthorne</i> (1897); and, with her husband, <i>A Story
of Courage: Annals of the Georgetown Convent of the Visitation
of the Blessed Virgin Mary</i> (1894).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LATIMER, HUGH<a name="ar234" id="ar234"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1490-1555), English bishop, and one
of the chief promoters of the Reformation in England, was born
at Thurcaston, Leicestershire. He was the son of a yeoman,
who rented a farm &ldquo;of three or four pounds by year at the
uttermost.&rdquo; Of this farm he &ldquo;tilled as much as kept half a
dozen men,&rdquo; retaining also grass for a hundred sheep and thirty
cattle. The year of Latimer&rsquo;s birth is not definitely known.
In the <i>Life</i> by Gilpin it is given as 1470, a palpable error, and
possibly a misprint for 1490.<a name="fa1r" id="fa1r" href="#ft1r"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Foxe states that at &ldquo;the age of
fourteen years he was sent to the university of Cambridge,&rdquo;
and as he was elected fellow of Clare in 1509, his year of entrance
was in all likelihood 1505. Latimer himself also, in mentioning
his conversion from Romanism about 1523, says that it took
place after he was thirty years of age. According to Foxe,
Latimer went to school &ldquo;at the age of four or thereabout.&rdquo;
The purpose of his parents was to train him up &ldquo;in the knowledge
of all good literature,&rdquo; but his father &ldquo;was as diligent to teach
him to shoot as any other thing.&rdquo; As the yeomen of England
were then in comparatively easy circumstances, the practice
of sending their sons to the universities was quite usual; indeed
Latimer mentions that in the reign of Edward VI., on account
of the increase of rents, the universities had begun wonderfully
to decay. He graduated B.A. in 1510 and M.A. in 1514. Before
the latter date he had taken holy orders. While a student he
was not unaccustomed &ldquo;to make good cheer and be merry,&rdquo;
but at the same time he was a punctilious observer of the minutest
rites of his faith and &ldquo;as obstinate a Papist as any in England.&rdquo;
So keen was his opposition to the new learning that his oration
on the occasion of taking his degree of bachelor of divinity was
devoted to an attack on the opinions of Melanchthon. It was
this sermon that determined his friend Thomas Bilney to go to
Latimer&rsquo;s study, and ask him &ldquo;for God&rsquo;s sake to hear his
confession,&rdquo; the result being that &ldquo;from that time forward he
began to smell the word of God, and forsook the school doctors
and such fooleries.&rdquo; Soon his discourses exercised a potent
influence on learned and unlearned alike; and, although he
restricted himself, as indeed was principally his custom through
life, to the inculcation of practical righteousness, and the censure
of clamant abuses, a rumour of his heretical tendencies reached
the bishop of Ely, who resolved to become unexpectedly one of
his audience. Latimer, on seeing him enter the church, boldly
changed his theme to a portrayal of Christ as the pattern priest
and bishop. The points of comparison were, of course, deeply
distasteful to the prelate, who, though he professed his &ldquo;obligations
for the good admonition he had received,&rdquo; informed the
preacher that he &ldquo;smelt somewhat of the pan.&rdquo; Latimer was
prohibited from preaching in the university or in any pulpits of
the diocese, and on his occupying the pulpit of the Augustinian
monastery, which enjoyed immunity from episcopal control,
he was summoned to answer for his opinions before Wolsey, who,
however, was so sensible of the value of such discourses that he
gave him special licence to preach throughout England.</p>

<p>At this time Protestant opinions were being disseminated in
England chiefly by the surreptitious circulation of the works
of Wycliffe, and especially of his translations of the New Testament.
The new leaven had begun to communicate its subtle
influence to the universities, but was working chiefly in secret
and even to a great extent unconsciously to those affected by it,
for many were in profound ignorance of the ultimate tendency
of their own opinions. This was perhaps, as regards England,
the most critical conjuncture in the history of the Reformation,
both on this account and on account of the position in which
Henry VIII. then stood related to it. In no small degree its
ultimate fate seemed also to be placed in the hands of Latimer.
In 1526 the imprudent zeal of Robert Barnes had resulted in an
ignominious recantation, and in 1527 Bilney, Latimer&rsquo;s most
trusted coadjutor, incurred the displeasure of Wolsey, and did
humiliating penance for his offences. Latimer, however, besides
possessing sagacity, quick insight into character, and a ready
and formidable wit which thoroughly disconcerted and confused
his opponents, had naturally a distaste for mere theological
discussion, and the truths he was in the habit of inculcating
could scarcely be controverted, although, as he stated them, they
were diametrically contradictory of prevailing errors both in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>243</span>
doctrine and practice. In December 1529 he preached his two
&ldquo;sermons on the cards,&rdquo; which awakened a turbulent controversy
in the university, and his opponents, finding that they were
unable to cope with the dexterity and keenness of his satire,
would undoubtedly have succeeded in getting him silenced by
force, had it not been reported to the king that Latimer &ldquo;favoured
his cause,&rdquo; that is, the cause of the divorce. While, therefore,
both parties were imperatively commanded to refrain from
further dispute, Latimer was invited to preach before Henry
in the Lent of 1530. The king was so pleased with the sermon
that after it &ldquo;he did most familiarly talk with him in a gallery.&rdquo;
Of the special regard which Henry seemed to have conceived
for him Latimer took advantage to pen the famous letter on the
free circulation of the Bible, an address remarkable, not only
for what Froude justly calls &ldquo;its almost unexampled grandeur,&rdquo;
but for its striking repudiation of the aid of temporal weapons
to defend the faith, &ldquo;for God,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;will not have it
defended by man or man&rsquo;s power, but by His Word only, by which
He hath evermore defended it, and that by a way far above man&rsquo;s
power and reason.&rdquo; Though the appeal was without effect
on the immediate policy of Henry, he could not have been
displeased with its tone, for shortly afterwards he appointed
Latimer one of the royal chaplains. In times so &ldquo;out of joint&rdquo;
Latimer soon became &ldquo;weary of the court,&rdquo; and it was with a
sense of relief that he accepted the living of West Kington,
or West Kineton, Wiltshire, conferred on him by the king in
1531. Harassed by severe bodily ailments, encompassed by a
raging tumult of religious conflict and persecution, and aware
that the faint hopes of better times which seemed to gild the
horizon of the future might be utterly darkened by a failure
either in the constancy of his courage or in his discernment and
discretion, he exerted his eloquence with unabating energy in
the furtherance of the cause he had at heart. At last a sermon he
was persuaded to preach in London exasperated John Stokesley,
bishop of the diocese, and seemed to furnish that fervent persecutor
with an opportunity to overthrow the most dangerous
champion of the new opinions. Bilney, of whom Latimer wrote,
&ldquo;if such as he shall die evil, what shall become of me?&rdquo; perished
at the stake in the autumn of 1531, and in January following
Latimer was summoned to answer before the bishops in the
consistory. After a tedious and captious examination, he
was in March brought before convocation, and, on refusing to
subscribe certain articles, was excommunicated and imprisoned;
but through the interference of the king he was finally released
after he had voluntarily signified his acceptance of all the articles
except two, and confessed that he had erred not only &ldquo;in
discretion but in doctrine.&rdquo; If in this confession he to some
extent tampered with his conscience, there is every reason to
believe that his culpable timidity was occasioned, not by personal
fear, but by anxiety lest by his death he should hinder instead
of promoting the cause of truth. After the consecration of
Cranmer to the archbishopric of Canterbury in 1533 Latimer&rsquo;s
position was completely altered. A commission appointed to
inquire into the disturbances caused by his preaching in Bristol
severely censured the conduct of his opponents; and, when the
bishop prohibited him from preaching in his diocese, he obtained
from Cranmer a special licence to preach throughout the province
of Canterbury. In 1534 Henry formally repudiated the authority
of the pope, and from this time Latimer was the chief co-operator
with Cranmer and Cromwell in advising the king regarding the
series of legislative measures which rendered that repudiation
complete and irrevocable.</p>

<p>It was, however, the preaching of Latimer more than the edicts
of Henry that established the principles of the Reformation in
the minds and hearts of the people; and from his preaching
the movement received its chief colour and complexion. The
sermons of Latimer possess a combination of qualities which
constitute them unique examples of that species of literature.
It is possible to learn from them more regarding the social and
political condition of the period than perhaps from any other
source, for they abound, not only in exposures of religious
abuses, and of the prevailing corruptions of society, but in
references to many varieties of social injustice and unwise
customs, in racy sketches of character, and in vivid pictures
of special features of the time, occasionally illustrated by
interesting incidents in his own life. The homely terseness of
his style, his abounding humour&mdash;rough, cheery and playful, but
irresistible in its simplicity, and occasionally displaying sudden
and dangerous barbs of satire&mdash;his avoidance of dogmatic subtleties,
his noble advocacy of practical righteousness, his bold and
open denunciation of the oppression practised by the powerful,
his scathing diatribes against ecclesiastical hypocrisy, the
transparent honesty of his fervent zeal, tempered by sagacious
moderation&mdash;these are the qualities which not only rendered
his influence so paramount in his lifetime, but have transmitted
his memory to posterity as perhaps that of the one among his
contemporaries most worthy of our interest and admiration.</p>

<p>In September 1535 Latimer was consecrated bishop of
Worcester. While holding this office he was selected to officiate
as preacher when the friar, John Forest, whom he vainly endeavoured
to move to submission, was burned at the stake
for denying the royal supremacy. In 1539, being opposed to
the &ldquo;act of the six articles,&rdquo; Latimer resigned his bishopric,
learning from Cromwell that this was the wish of the king. It
would appear that on this point he was deceived, but as he now
declined to accept the articles he was confined within the precincts
of the palace of the bishop of Chichester. After the
attainder of Cromwell little is known of Latimer until 1546,
when, on account of his connexion with the preacher Edward
Crome, he was summoned before the council at Greenwich, and
committed to the Tower of London. Henry died before his
final trial could take place, and the general pardon at the
accession of Edward VI. procured him his liberty. He declined
to resume his see, notwithstanding the special request of the
Commons, but in January 1548 again began to preach, and
with more effectiveness than ever, crowds thronging to listen
to him both in London and in the country. Shortly after the
accession of Mary in 1553 a summons was sent to Latimer to
appear before the council at Westminster. Though he might
have escaped by flight, and though he knew, as he quaintly
remarked, that &ldquo;Smithfield already groaned for him,&rdquo; he at
once joyfully obeyed. The pursuivant, he said, was &ldquo;a welcome
messenger.&rdquo; The hardships of his imprisonment, and the long
disputations at Oxford, told severely on his health, but he
endured all with unbroken cheerfulness. On the 16th of October
1555 he and Ridley were led to the stake at Oxford. Never
was man more free than Latimer from the taint of fanaticism
or less dominated by &ldquo;vainglory,&rdquo; but the motives which now
inspired his courage not only placed him beyond the influence
of fear, but enabled him to taste in dying an ineffable thrill of
victorious achievement. Ridley he greeted with the words,
&ldquo;Be of good comfort, Master Ridley, and play the man; we
shall this day light such a candle by God&rsquo;s grace in England
as (I trust) shall never be put out.&rdquo; He &ldquo;received the flame
as it were embracing it. After he had stroked his face with his
hands, and (as it were) bathed them a little in the fire, he soon
died (as it appeared) with very little pain or none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two volumes of Latimer&rsquo;s sermons were published in 1549. A
complete edition of his works, edited by G. E. Corrie for the Parker
Society, appeared in two volumes (1844-1845). His <i>Sermon on the
Ploughers</i> and <i>Seven Sermons preached before Edward VI.</i> were reprinted
by E. Arber (1869). The chief contemporary authorities for
his life are his own <i>Sermons</i>, John Stow&rsquo;s <i>Chronicle</i> and Foxe&rsquo;s <i>Book
of Martyrs</i>. In addition to memoirs prefixed to editions of his
sermons, there are lives of Latimer by R. Demaus (1869, new and
revised ed. 1881), and by R. M. and A. J. Carlyle (1899).</p>

<p><a name="ft1r" id="ft1r" href="#fa1r"><span class="fn">1</span></a> The only reasons for assigning an earlier date are that he was
commonly known as &ldquo;old Hugh Latimer,&rdquo; and that Bernher, his
Swiss servant, states incidentally that he was &ldquo;above threescore and
seven years&rdquo; in the reign of Edward VI. Bad health and anxieties
probably made him look older than his years, but under Edward VI.
his powers as an orator were in full vigour, and he was at his book
winter and summer at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LATINA, VIA,<a name="ar235" id="ar235"></a></span> an ancient highroad of Italy, leading S.E.
from Rome. It was probably one of the oldest of Roman roads,
leading to the pass of Algidus, so important in the early military
history of Rome; and it must have preceded the Via Appia
as a route to Campania, inasmuch as the Latin colony at Cales
was founded in 334 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> and must have been accessible from
Rome by road, whereas the Via Appia was only made twenty-two
years later. It follows, too, a far more natural line of
communication, without the engineering difficulties which the
Via Appia had to encounter. As a through route it no doubt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>244</span>
preceded the Via Labicana (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Labicana, Via</a></span>), though the latter
may have been preferred in later times. After their junction,
the Via Latina continued to follow the valley of the Trerus
(Sacco), following the line taken by the modern railway to
Naples, and passing below the Hernican hill-towns, Anagnia,
Ferentinum, Frusino, &amp;c. At Fregellae it crossed the Liris,
and then passed through Aquinum and Casinum, both of them
comparatively low-lying towns. It then entered the interval
between the Apennines and the volcanic group of Rocca Monfina,
and the original road, instead of traversing it, turned abruptly
N.E. over the mountains to Venafrum, thus giving a direct
communication with the interior of Samnium by roads to
Aesernia and Telesia. In later times, however, there was in all
probability a short cut by Rufrae along the line taken by the
modern highroad and railway. The two lines rejoined near the
present railway station of Caianello and the road ran to Teanum
and Cales, and so to Casilinum, where was the crossing of the
Volturnus and the junction with the Via Appia. The distance
from Rome to Casilinum was 129 m. by the Via Appia, 135 m.
by the old Via Latina through Venafrum, 126 m. by the short
cut by Rufrae. Considerable remains of the road exist in the
neighbourhood of Rome; for the first 40 m., as far as Compitum
Anagninum, it is not followed by any modern road; while farther
on in its course it is in the main identical with the modern highroad.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LATINI, BRUNETTO<a name="ar236" id="ar236"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1210-<i>c.</i> 1294), Italian philosopher
and scholar, was born in Florence, and belonged to the Guelph
party. After the disaster of Montaperti he took refuge for some
years (1261-1268) in France, but in 1269 returned to Tuscany
and for some twenty years held successive high offices. Giovanni
Villani says that &ldquo;he was a great philosopher and a consummate
master of rhetoric, not only in knowing how to speak well, but
how to write well.... He both began and directed the growth
of the Florentines, both in making them ready in speaking well
and in knowing how to guide and direct our republic according
to the rules of politics.&rdquo; He was the author of various works
in prose and verse. While in France he wrote in French his
prose <i>Trésor</i>, a summary of the encyclopaedic knowledge of the
day (translated into Italian as <i>Tesoro</i> by Bono Giamboni in the
13th century), and in Italian his poem <i>Tesoretto</i>, rhymed couplets
in heptasyllabic metre, a sort of abridgment put in allegorical
form, the earliest Italian didactic verse. He is famous as the
friend and counsellor of Dante (see <i>Inferno</i>, xv. 82-87).</p>
